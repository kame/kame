Let's call the entire file-tree under this directory "the KAME tree".

This directory contains several information files and two directories.
The "kame" directory contains files created by the KAME project, which
are shareable among NetBSD, FreeBSD, and other operating systems.  The
other directory is for your target operating system.  For example, if
you are on NetBSD, the KAME tree looks like this:

kame --+-- INSTALL		(the document you are looking at)
       +-- kame --+-- sys	(kernel source code shared among OSes)
       |          +-- kame --+-- libinet6
       |		     +-- ....
       |			(userland source code shared among OSes)
       |
       +-- netbsd --+-- INSTALL	(NetBSD-specific installation document)
		    +-- sys	(kernel source code specific to NetBSD)
		    +-- lib --+-- libinet6
		    |	      +-- ...
		    +-- ...	(userland source code specific to NetBSD)

The KAME tree has no direct relationship with "/usr/src" tree.  You do
not need to care about /usr/src at all.  Please follow the following
instructions.

Except for bsdi[34], sufficient files are provided in the KAME tree to
bulid complete set of IPv6/IPsec binaries.  You don't have to apply
any patches.

For bsdi[34], due to license restrictions, some necessary files are
not provided (we are not allowed to redistribute the whole source code
tree).  You have to complete the KAME tree by yourself.  For example,
for bsdi[34], we cannot ship entire "sys" tree under kame/bsdi3/sys.
"sys.diff" is included in the KAME kit instead.  You need to extract
"sys" tree under kame/bsdi3/sys by following step 2 in this document.

kame --+-- INSTALL
       +-- kame --+-- sys
       |          +-- kame --+-- libinet6
       |		     +-- ....
       |
       +-- bsdi3 --+-- INSTALL
		   +-- sys.diff		<--- need to extract "sys" tree here
		   +-- lib --+-- libinet6
		   |	      +-- ...
		   +-- ...

NOTE: On some operating systems it is possible to perform "make obj"
before building.  However, it is not recommended since it might cause
troubles with anoncvs operation.  For example, the "update" target for
Makefile in the top-level directory will become unusable.  Do not
perform "make obj" unless you are ready to tackle those troubles.

0. If you have an installed KAME kit in the past, you may need to
   remove the files under "/usr/local/v6" to avoid conflicts or misuse
   of the old files during building.  We recommend you to remove the
   following, at least:
	/usr/local/v6/lib/*
   Also, do not forget to update "/usr/include" in step 5 (see below),
   otherwise the include files and source code become out-of-sync.

1. See the "VERSION" file and identify a symbol name for your target
   operating system. For the rest of this document, we assume "netbsd"
   for explanation.
  
2. Be sure to have the complete KAME tree.  For certain platforms
   (namely bsdi3 and bsdi4) we cannot ship the whole source code tree
   into the KAME tar.gz file, and you need to
	- copy/untar fresh tree from CD-ROM/whatever
	- apply patch included in KAME kit
   Please read section 0 in bsdi[34]/INSTALL before proceed further,
   if you are using bsdi[34].

3. Invoke the following:
	% make TARGET=netbsd prepare
   This will create necessary symbolic links for building (from the
   "netbsd" tree to the "kame" tree).  NOTE: You'll need the "perl"
   interpreter to invoke this.  If you see any error message from the
   the process, you skipped some of steps required.  Do not proceed
   further.

4. Some parts of the KAME tree will be compiled, only if there are
   certain libraries installed beforehand:
	usr.sbin/racoon:
		Compiles only when OpenSSL 0.9.5a (or later) is installed
		beforehand, and shell search path is configured to
		reach "openssl" program.
   Please install those libraries before building.

   We support the following installations.

   - Your system has OpenSSL installed by default.  FreeBSD 4.2-RELEASE,
     BSD/OS 4.2 and NetBSD 1.5 fall into this category.

   - A system with OpenSSL, installed manually with default installation path.
	This means that you gave no option to "./configure".  In this case
	you should have /usr/local/ssl/include/openssl/des.h.

   - A system with OpenSSL, installed via FreeBSD ports system.
	Note that we do not support ports-current.  Please stick to the
	ports directory came with the FreeBSD revioin you are using, or
	the one came with KAME kit.  In this case you should have
	/usr/local/include/openssl/des.h.  We do not support
	ports with non-standard LOCALBASE/PREFIX.

   If you install OpenSSL with some other ways, the KAME tree may fail
   to find OpenSSL and omit compilation of, for example,
   usr.sbin/racoon.

5. Go down to the target directory that you have specified (e.g
   "netbsd"), and read document named "INSTALL" (placed in somewhere
   like "netbsd/INSTALL").  

Good luck!
