			CHANGELOG for KAME kit
$KAME: CHANGELOG,v 1.1930 2001/10/23 12:26:37 jinmei Exp $

<200110>
2001-10-23  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6_gif.c (in6_gif_output):
	* kame/sys/netinet/in_gif.c (in_gif_output):
	Corrected the loop prevation algorithm.  The current one is not
	effective, because it tries to detecte the loop condition only
	when generating a new route without removing the cached route.
	Luckily, the bug does not necessarily mean we'll see infinite
	loop, since we have another mechanism for loop prevention in
	gif_output().

2001-10-23  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c: NULL-clear m->m_pkthdr.rcvif
	before calling ip6_mforward(). [KAME PR sys/387]

2001-10-23  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/v6test: removed the -c option introduced on
	2001-09-16, just because we do not need the function.

Tue Oct 23 10:11:07 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/kame/racoon:
	racoon gives up the negotiation when racoon cannot find any pre-shared
	key in the case of the aggressive mode AND verify_identifier is set on.

Mon Oct 22 18:28:07 JST 2001 keiichi@iij.ad.jp
	* kame/sys/netinet6/mip6_binding.c
        - fix a bug of the updating routine of the BC entries
          of CNs when the unregistering has finished.

Mon Oct 22 14:54:26 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* nodeinfod: support IPv4 node addresses.
	* sys/netinet6/icmp6.c: do not respond to IPv4 node addresses query,
	  with a bogus packet.

Sat Oct 20 03:09:33 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* freebsd4/sys/netinet/udp_usrreq.c:
	the data in the ip header should be restored when the extended udp
	header and data checksum is calculated.  this caused some trouble
	in the code which the ip header is not modified.  for example,
	inbound policy lookup failed.

Fri Oct 19 16:57:58 2001  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* freebsd4/ports/{ct,v6eval}: upgrade to 1.3.

Fri Oct 19 15:41:09 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/nd6.c: repair binary backward compatibility breakage
	  for SIOCGPRLST_IN6 ioctl.

Fri Oct 19 09:54:19 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/sys/key.c:
	the value of the prefixlen in the sadb_address structure is fixed.
	when pfkey message relative to SA is sent, the prefixlen was incorrect.
	reported by <archie@packetdesign.com>.

Thu Oct 18 17:16:19 JST 2001 keiichi@iij.ad.jp
	* kame/sys/netinet6/mip6*
	- fix a bug that a HA sends wrong seq number when issuing a
	  'too small seqno' binding ack.

Thu Oct 18 14:25:36 JST 2001 keiichi@iij.ad.jp
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c
	do not touch any extention headers during the mip6 processing
	if IPV6_FORWARDING is set.

2001-10-17 Shin'ichi Fujisawa	<fujisawa@kame.net>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_trans.c:
	- Fix a bug to miscalculate when compute a checksum in IPv4 ->
	  IPv4 translation.
	- Remove natpt_recalculateTCP4Checksum() and related include
	  file. This function became useless by modification mentioned above.

Wed Oct 17 00:03:54 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/kame/racoon:
	fixed the internal value of the wild card of the upper layer protocol.
	the value of the wile card is differnt between the kernel and IKE
	protocol.  reported by <gunther@aurora.regenstrief.org>.

Tue Oct 16 23:56:34 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/kame/racoon:
	to compare the policy between own policy and peer's policy in the
	responder side, it should be loose.  for example, the initiator
	proposes "any", and the responder requires "tcp", this case is
	admitted.  also, the initiator proposes "tcp", and the responder
	accepts "any", this case is admitted too.  however this behavior
	should be considered.

Tue Oct 16 19:22:52 JST 2001 keiichi@iij.ad.jp
	* kame/sys/netinet6/mip6_binding.c
	fix the bug of the validation routine of an incoming tunneled
	packet from a homeagent to a mobile node.

Tue Oct 16 16:09:22 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* bsdi4/sys/netinet/ip_icmp.c:
	  do not panic even if last arg to icmp_error() is NULL.
	  this situation can happen when ICMPv4 too big is generated.
	  from markus@openbsd.  bsdi4 only.

Mon Oct 15 21:25:29 JST 2001 keiichi@iij.ad.jp
	* icmp6.c
	swap the ip6_src and the address in the homeaddress destopt
	(if exists) in icmp6_error() routine.

2001-10-15 Shin'ichi Fujisawa	<fujisawa@kame.net>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_{defs.h,trans.c}
	- Fix a bug to miscalculate when compute a checksum in
	  IPv6 -> IPv4 translation.

Thu Oct 11 21:57:50 JST 2001 keiichi@iij.ad.jp
	mip6
	* fix BU list management function.
	* introduce MIP6_ALLOW_COA_FALLBACK kernel option.
	  this allows you to use a coa as a src address if the peer
	  doesn't recognize a home address destination option.
	  may arouse a mip6 believe's anger, but very useful.

Wed Oct 10 17:38:05 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/kame/racoon:
	Fixed racoon crash when uni-directional policy is defined.
	racoon negoticate two SAs even in the case of the uni-directional
	policy.

Wed Oct 10 04:52:54 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* bsdi4: use PULLDOWN_TEST (m_pulldown) codepath.  improves conformance
	  when ipv6 extension headers are present.

Wed Oct 10 10:27:24 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd/sys/netinet/raw_ip.c: fix a typo which could lead to kernel
	  panic when ICMPv4 is returned against raw ip socket.
	  reported by kato@wide

2001-10-10  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/rtadvd/rtadvd.c (find_prefix, prefix_match): corrected
	prefix calculation:
	- avoid invalid pointer access when bytelen is a multiple of 8
	- avoid using the right shift operator to make the code look safer

2001-10-09  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/rtadvd/config.c (getconfig): made configuration parser
	compatible with FreeBSD 4.4-RELEASE, in terms of the route
	information option:
	- allowed rtrXXX instead of rtXXX.
	- made route lifetime optional.
	In any case, some warning messages are printed as well, so that the
	user can notice the change and fix the configuration.

Tue Oct  9 08:43:04 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/kame/racoon/schedule.c:
	the entry of the schedule is marked with dead before the function in
	the entry will be called.  some schedules, check_rtsock(),
	check_flushsa_stub, woulbe be remained in the scheduler even after they
	were excuted. sched_scrub_param() is unnecessary probably anymore.

2001-10-04  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/contrib/bind/src/lib/irs/dns_ho.c (add_hostent):
	calculated alignment correctly.  Without this fix, gethostbyname()
	would not work correctly when the function handles more than one
	address.
	This is a back merge of a fix from bsdi to BSD/OS 4.3 (beta).

2001-10-02	suz@sdl.hitachi.co.jp
	* freebsd4/lib/libinet6/Makefile
	- "options insecure1" is available on FreeBSD4-KAME, too.
	(you have to rebuild applications to enjoy this feature)

2001-10-01 Shin'ichi Fujisawa	<fujisawa@kame.net>
	* kame/kame/{natptconfig,natptlog}:
	- Add contents of manual page.
	- Separate contents of configuration file as natpt.conf.5.

<200109>
2001-09-26  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6_ifattach.c (in6_ifattach): calls
	nd6_ifattach() before creating addresses.  This is necessary
	because an MLD packet may be sent during the creation procedure,
	in which a valid nd_ifinfo entry can be referred to.

Wed Sep 26 14:30:46 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/kame/racoon:
	new directive "verify_identifier" has been added.  it can be strict
	to check the identifier in the ID payload transmitted by the peer.
	the default is off.

Wed Sep 26 00:01:08 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/sys/netkey/key.c:
	* kame/kame/setkey:
	the syntax how to define a policy of a ICMPv6 type and/or a code
	has been changed.  the previous modification at Fri Sep 21 broke
	a backward compatibility, and had no sense.  when the policy doesn't
	require IPsec for an inbound Neighbor Solicitation with any source
	/destination address, the specification is the following;
		spdadd ::/0 ::/0 icmp6 135,0 -P out none;

2001-09-25  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/addrselect/: a tool to configure the policy table (see
	below).  This program is also an experimental stuff.

2001-09-25  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6_src.c: implemented the policy table for
	source address selection, according to
	draft-ietf-ipngwg-default-addr-select-05.
	The policy table can be configured via the sysctl(3) interface
	(except for FreeBSD, at this moment).  This implementation is
	still experimental, and might be changed in the near future.

2001-09-21  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6.c (fill_[dp]rlist): added as shared
	subroutines for nd6_sysctl_[dp]rlist (for FreeBSD) and nd6_sysctl
	(for other *BSDs), in order to centralize the complicated logic.

2001-09-21  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6_rtr.c (defrouter_select): removed the
	default route if there was neither a default router nor the
	default interface.

2001-09-21  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6_src.c (in6_selectroute): made sure to fill
	in retifp and retrt, regardless of the return value.  Without this
	change, the kernel could panic, since ip6_output() refers to the
	returned ifp even in error cases.
	All versions of the kernel after the 20010730 snap should be
	upgraded to fix this problem.

2001-09-21  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/(various files): fixed integer overflow for
	valid and preferred lifetimes;
	- introduced new members in nd_prefix{} and in6_ifaddr{} to record
	  the timestamp of the latest update
	- check expiration based on the difference between the current
	  time and the timestamp, not on the explicit expiration times

Fri Sep 21 14:19:02 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ipsec.c:
	When the value of the upper layer of the security policy index (spidx)
	structure is ICMPv6, the port field in "src" of the spidx means ICMPv6
	type, and the port field in "dst" of the spidx specifies ICMPv6 code.
	For example, the following means the policy doesn't require IPsec for
	an inbound Neighbor Solicitation.
		spdadd ::/0[135] ::/0 icmp6 -P in none;

2001-09-20  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6_rtr.c (prelist_update): corrected the
	definition of "storedlifetime" (used in the two-hour rule) for an
	address that has an infinite lifetime.  Without this special
	case, the lifetime of such an address would unintentionally be
	decreased.

2001-09-19  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/v6test/: added some tiny improvements/corrections:
	- added missing NTOHS
	- corrected checksum calculation for packets with routing headers
	- made the checksum calculation routine against invalid packets
	The fist two were based on comments from Yutaka Shimizu
	<jacky@open.tjsys.co.jp>.

2001-09-19 Shin'ichi Fujisawa	<fujisawa@kame.net>
	* freebsd4/sys/netinet/udp_usrreq.c:
	- Remove 'static' attribute from variable "udpcksum".
	* kame/kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_trans.c:
	- Examine net.inet.udp.checksum when making UDP packet.
	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_{defs.h,{dispatch,trans,tslot}.c}:
	- traceroute6 works.  I forgot to review it.

Wed Sep 19 19:06:06 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ip6_{in,out}put.c: make IPV6_TCLASS socket option to
	  take int, not u_int8_t.  follows the latest 2292bis draft.
	  (backward binary compatibility is provided for bsdi43)

Thu Sep 20 01:00:08 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/kame/rtsold:
	improved the -a option.  it can probe a interface automatically when
	the interface wake up.  it can be started anytime even when there is no
	network interface on the list of intarfaces in the kernel.

2001-09-18  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/libinet6/resolv/res_send.c (res_send):
	* bsdi4/contrib/bind/src/lib/resolv/res_send.c (res_nsend):
	if a UDP response from a "wrong" server is truncated (and if we
	allow to accept such responses), fall back to TCP with the "wrong"
	address, in order to avoid connecting to an anycast address.

2001-09-16  suz@sdl.hitachi.co.jp
	* kame/kame/v6test/testcap.[ch](tgetnum), getconfig.c: fixed a
	bug that you sometimes cannot specify a value if its MSB is on.

	* kame/kame/v6test/cksum.c(cksum6), v6test.c(main), v6test.1:
	added an option not to generate checksum automatically.

2001-09-15  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/v6test/getconfig.c (make_rthdr): fixed routing header
	generation.

2001-09-13  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/usr.bin/telnet/commands.c (tn): made it sure to terminate
	the loop of connection attempt correctly, based on a comment from
	murakami@pana.net.

2001-09-13  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6.c (nd6_timer): before calling
	icmp6_error(), embedded scope zone ID (if necessary) for the
	erroneous packet.

Thu Sep 13 08:15:21 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/sys/netkey/key.c:
	newer SA is prefered for a out-bound packet than old one
	when net.key.prefered_oldsa is set to zero.

Thu Sep 13 08:12:46 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ipsec.c:
	fixed to process a IPv6 packet when ah transport after esp tunnel
	should be applied.  the SA of AH transport could not be selected
	from the SAD because of this bug.

Wed Sep 12 16:19:42 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/racoon/proposal.c:
	fixed to compare pfs values in two proposals in the case of
	"claim" mode.  reported by <vanhu@free.fr>

2001-09-13  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/scope6.c (in6_addr2zoneid): changed the return
	value type from u_int32_t to int64_t, so that the caller can tell
	an error from valid "4+28" ID values.  All the callers of this
	function were also modified accordingly, with stricter validation
	checks.

2001-09-03 Shin'ichi Fujisawa	<fujisawa@kame.net>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_{rule.h,trans.c,var.h}:
	- Support tftp translation.  Tftp6 client can connect to tftp4
	  server.

2001-09-10  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/udp6_output.c (udp6_output): (bsdi4 and
	netbsd) when sending IPv4 packets represented as IPv4-mapped IPv6
	address, passed socket option to ip_output() so that the function
	would handle broadcasted packet correctly.  For bsdi4, also merged
	all-ones broadcast cases from udp_usrreq.c.

2001-09-07  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c (ip6_setpktoptions): checked if
	each cmsghdr pointer had enough size to store the structure.
	This could be a security fix, but I think the current code is
	practically safe enough.  That is, we do not have to be in a harry
	to merge this fix to *BSDs.

2001-09-06  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* *bsd/sys/sys/socket.h (CMSG_FIRSTHDR): checked msg_controllen
	in CMSG_FIRSTHDR as described in RFC2292, particularly in case
	that the kernel returns an empty list for some reasons.
	(based on a note from David Borman <dab@bsdi.com>)

2001-09-05  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/contrib/bind/src/lib/resolv/res_send.c (res_nsend):
	* kame/kame/libinet6/resolv/res_send.c (res_send):
	when "insecure1" is specified, do not connect datagram sockets,
	so that the kernel can accept responses from an "unknown" server.

2001-09-05  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_input.c (ip6_sysctl): (bsdi4 only) made
	net.inet[6].ip6.v6only modifiable.

Wed Sep  5 12:05:14 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* faithd: change the default directory for daemons and configuration
	  files.  was: /usr/local/v6/{libexec,etc}, now: /usr/libexec and /etc.

2001-09-05  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/sys/netinet/in_pcb.c (in_pcballoc): when
	net.inet[6].ip6.v6only is 1, set IN6P_IPV6_V6ONLY (which
	corresponds to the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option) for all sockets at
	socket(2).

Tue Sep  4 01:32:49 2001  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* freebsd4/usr.sbin/ppp: import IPv6 supporting PPP from
	  FreeBSD-current.

2001-09-03 Shin'ichi Fujisawa	<fujisawa@kame.net>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_*.[ch]:
	* freebsd4/usr.sbin/{natptconfig,natptd,natptlog}:
	KAME NAT-PT (kernel and user command) code was completely renewed.
	Major changes are as follows.
	- Changed a coding style to "bsd" (described in IMPLEMENTATION,
	  chapter 8).
	- Does not depend on interface.
	  'interface' directive was removed in configuration rule, and no
	  inbound/outbound distinction in each rule.
	- Changed a syntax of configuration command (natptconfig) related to
	  the item mentioned above.  The syntax does not change greatly, it
	  became simpler.
	- Use TAILQ (defined in /usr/include/sys/queue.h) instead of my
	  original list handle routines. 
	- Removed natptd user command.
	  Because the facility that natptd aimed is the same as totd.

2001-09-02  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi[34]/sys/sys/mbuf.h (MFREE): corrected the point of calling
	splmem_fast(), so that the lock would not be freed
	unintentionally.  A busy kernel, such as the one processing IPsec,
	could panic without this fix, so all bsdi users are recommended to
	apply this fix.
	The fix is a back port from BSD/OS 4.3 beta.

<200108>
2001-08-31  SUZUKI Shinsuke  <suz@sdl.hitachi.co.jp>
	* pim6sd/pim6_proto.c (parse_pim6_hello): strengthens length check for
	Hello packet.  Without this fix, pim6sd may crash if it receives a
	Hello packet with a too short Hello option.

2001-08-31  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/{in6.c in6_ifattach.c, nd6_rtr.c}: revised the
	support of the privacy extension of stateless address
	configuration, based on draft-ietf-ipngwg-temp-addresses-v2-00.
	See Section 8. of the document to see feature changes.
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6_var.h: added a new member "ia6_createtime"
	to the in6_ifaddr structure with the change above, in order to
	record the time of creation of an address.  This member is set for
	all addresses, but is only referred for temporary addresses.

2001-08-30  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/sys/netinet/tcp_input.c (tcp_rtlookup): always used
	rtcalloc() so that both active and passive connections would make
	cloned host routes.  The previous code, which called rtalloc(),
	should not have severe bad effects, but using rtcalloc() is more
	suitable to bsdi's logic.

2001-08-28  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/ndp/ndp.c (ifinfo):
	- printed the values of ND6_IFF_ACCEPT_RTADV and
	  ND6_IFF_PREFER_SOURCE by 'ndp -i IF'
	- allowed a user to specify the flag bits by
	  'ndp -i IF [-]accept_rtadv' or
	  'ndp -i IF [-] prefer_source', respectively.

2001-08-28  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6.h:
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6_src.c (in6_selectsrc):
	introduced a new flag bit "ND6_IFF_PREFER_SOURCE" in the nd_ifinfo
	structure, in order to specify "preferred" interfaces for source
	address selection.

2001-08-28  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6.[ch]:
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6_rtr.c (nd6_ra_input):
	introduced a new flag bit "ND6_IFF_ACCEPT_RTADV" in the nd_ifinfo
	structure, in order to control whether to accept RAs per-interface
	basis.  The kernel now accepts RAs only when
	net.inet6.ip6.accept_rtadv is 1 and the flag is on the receiving
	interface.  The new stuff does not change the old default
	behavior.

2001-08-28  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6_src.c (in6_selectsrc): corrected a
	condition on temporary addresses.

2001-08-22  kjc@csl.sony.co.jp
	* bsdi4/sys/net/if.h:
	add ALTQ-compat queue macros to bsdi4 in order to
	reduce "#ifdef ALTQ". (in paticular, sys/net/if_gif.c)
	(the commit mail didn't go out due to a permission problem in
	the repository.)

2001-08-18  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6_src.c (in6_selectsrc): changed the number
	of longest matching rule in source address selection from 8 to 14,
	so that it is easy to assign smaller numbers to more preferred
	rules.  Additionally, a new rule to prefer addresses on alive
	(i.e. IFF_UP) interfaces, based on a suggestion from
	kato@wide.ad.jp.
	*bsd/netstat were also changed accordingly.

Fri Aug 17 05:24:45 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* kame/setkey/parse.y: handle FQDN address in SPD/SAD configurations.
	  when an FQDN resolves into multiple addresses, setkey(8) will
	  install SPD/SAD entries for all possible combinations.
	  inspired by Solaris IPsec stack.

2001-08-16  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/usr.sbin/netstat/stats_inet6.h:
	* {freebsd4,netbsd}/usr.bin/netstat/inet6.c (ip6_stats):
	printed statistics about the source address selection rules.
	(experimental.  we may have to reconsider the way to print the
	stat.)

2001-08-16  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6_src.c (in6_selectsrc): implemented the
	source address selection algorithm based on
	draft-ietf-ipngwg-default-addr-select-05.  With this change, the
	older backend function, in6_ifawithscope(), to choose a source
	address was removed.  Also,
	- added statistics array to ip6stat to see which rule is applied
	  in the algorithm.
	- added a new sysctl variable "net.inet6.ip6.prefer_tempaddr" to
	  reverse the rule about temporary addresses.

2001-08-15  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/scope6.c (in6_addrscope): treat the loopback
	address as global, because there is no ambiguity about scoping.
	Otherwise, we'd see ::1%ID (ID != 0) via scope6_addr2default(),
	which would rather has bad effects.
	Note: I'm still not sure if this change is really safe.  We should
	take care of the new behavior.

2001-08-14 Keiichi SHIMA <keiichi@iij.ad.jp>
	* add a home agents list timeout routine.
	* add some init functions.

Tue Aug 14 15:01:57 JST 2001	suz@sdl.hitachi.co.jp
	* kame/pim6sd: explicitly assigns NULL to pointers in newly-
	malloced structures if there's no specific pointer to be assigned.

Tue Aug 14 05:20:23 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netkey/key.c: drop support for byte lifetime.  byte lifetime
	  is define in a very vague manner, and it can lead to unsynchronized
	  SAs (= dangling SA left behind) with packet losses, byte count
	  mismatches and other causes.  kernel returns EINVAL if non-zero
	  byte lifetime is specified on ADD/UPDATE.

Mon Aug 13 22:03:28 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/racoon:
	supported MODP 2048, 3072, 4096 and 8192-bit.
	these are described in draft-ietf-ipsec-ike-modp-groups-01.txt

2001-08-12  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c (ip6_setpktoption): newly added,
	in order to centralize the routine for handling outgoing packet
	options both as socket options and as ancillary data.
	It also introduced additional data validation.  For example,
	IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU is not allowed in the context of RFC2292 (i.e. by
	the IPV6_PKTOPTIONS.)

2001-08-09, Keiichi SHIMA <keiichi@iij.ad.jp>
	* add a relay routine for an icmp against an encaplulated packet.
	not tested.
	* free mbuf in case error in the functions that has an mbuf pointer
	in its	argument list.

Thu Aug  9 09:37:44 BST 2001	suz@sdl.hitachi.co.jp
	* kame/kame/pim6sd: s/vifi_t/mifi_t/ to sync with kernel implementation
	of IPv6 multicast interface. 

2001-08-07  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c (ip6_pcbopt, ip6_setpktoptions):
	for the IPV6_NEXTHOP ancillary data/socket option, set
	sin6_scope_id to 0 in non-SCOPEDROUTING cases, so that the kernel
	can make a neighbor cache for the specified nexthop with a scoped
	address.

Tue Aug  7 23:30:59 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/racoon:
	RFC2407 4.6.3.3 says that INITIAL-CONTACT is the notify message that
	announces the peer the sender of the message was rebooted.
	previous interpretation in racoon was to delete all SAs which
	source address is the sender of the message.
	with the change, racoon only deletes SA which matches BOTH the
	source address and the destination accress in the notify message.

Tue Aug  7 09:42:23 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* libinet6/getrrsetbyname.c: libc implementation of getrrsetbyname(3).
	  useful for racoon(8) cert-on-DNS handling.  from openbsd.

Mon Aug  6 21:18:58 BST 2001	suz@sdl.hitachi.co.jp
	* kame/kame/v6test/getconfig.c: you can build up a packet from 
	multiple raw-data entries.

Sun Aug  5 14:00:04 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ipsec.c: improve cached ipsec policy lookup on connected
	  SOCK_STREAM PCBs.

2001-08-03  Keiichi SHIMA <keiichi@iij.ad.jp>

	add mobileip source code.

	currently, many parts of spec are not implemented yet.  even
	uncompilable under other than freebsd4 now.  also very
	unstable.  of course, without MIP6 kernel option, there is no
	problem. all mip6 related code is separated by ifdef MIP6.

	this integration is just for KAME mip6 developper's
	convinience.  the purpose of this early integration is to
	decrease the maintenance cost to synchronize KAME main tree
	and developping mip6 tree.  after this merge, mip6 code
	modifications are reflected directly to KAME code.

	i will make these codes compilable on the other OSes as soon
	as possible.

2001-08-02  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/advapitest/sender.c (main): added a new option '-n
	nexthop' to test IPV6_NEXTHOP.

2001-08-02  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/{ip6_output.c, in6_src.c}: supported
	the IPV6_NEXTHOP ancillary data / socket option.
	At this moment, the next hop should be an AF_INET6 socket address.

2001-08-02  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6.c (nd6_is_addr_neighbor): check on-link
	prefixes (not addresses) to see if a given address is a neighbor
	in a given link.

<200107>
Tue Jul 31 22:54:57 JST 2001	suz@sdl.hitachi.co.jp
	* kame/kame/pim6sd/cfparse.y: command-line debug-option works now.

Tue Jul 31 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/racoon:
	the phase1 deletion should be postponed until there is no phase2.
	this was probably made a consensus at vpn bakeoff on Oct, 1998.

2001-07-29  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/(several files): several improvements on the
	IPv6 output routine:
	- added a seprate function in6_selectroute() to centralize the
	  route and outgoing interface selection algorithm
	- call in6_selectroute() from in6_selectsrc() and ip6_output(), and
	  use same codebase for both unicast and multicast packets as much
	  as possible
	- added stricter (and thorough) scope checks for outgoing packets
	  (e.g. this check would prevent a packet generated by
	  'ping6 -S ::1 fe80::1%ne0' from being sent)
	- renamed in6_addr2scopeid() to in6_addr2zoneid() to be more intuitive
	  in terms of the scope architecture
	- made in6_addr2zoneid take care of the loopback address
	- set the tentative flag before joinging multicast addresses, so
	  that the corresponding MLD packet would not have a tentative
	  source address

2001-07-29  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6_nbr.c (nd6_ns_output):
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6_nbr.c (nd6_na_output):
	* kame/sys/netinet6/icmp6.c (icmp6_redirect_output):
	do not pass a pointer to a pointer to ifnet to ip6_output() for
	counting statistics, use the interface on which the ND process is
	involved instead.

2001-07-29  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/mld6.c (mld6_input): allowed MLD messages to
	have the unspecified address as source.
	* kame/sys/netinet6/mld6.c (mld6_sendpkt): use the unspecified
	address when there is no valid link-local address available.

Fri Jul 27 17:39:24 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/net/if_sec.c: "sec*" pseudo device for decapsulating IPsec
	  tunnel packets.  if we have the device, we depart from RFC2401
	  tunnelling model (where IPsec tunnels are defined within IPsec
	  document) to draft-touch-ipsec-vpn-01.txt model on inbound.
	  all IPsec tunnel-mode SPD entries will automagically be accompanied
	  with a sec* device.  refer to IMPLEMENTATION for more details.

Fri Jul 27 12:49:47 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ipsec.c: cache ipsec policy on pcbs, try to avoid
	  per-packet SPD lookup.  idea from thorpej

2001-07-27  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/sys/net/if_loop.c (looutput): set M_LOOP for IPv6 packets.

Thu Jul 26 23:13:06 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* mdnsd: IPv4 support.  PR 370 from assar@assaris.sics.se

Thu Jul 26 02:12:04 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* *bsd*/sys/netinet*/in*_pcb.c: call ipsec_init_policy() from
	  within in*_pcballoc(), not from PRU_ATTACH logic.  it is to make
	  the allocation of ipsec policy struct prior to making inpcb available
	  to the world (don't show incomplete inpcb to others).
	  can lead to panic(), as reported on stable@freebsd.

Wed Jul 25 18:15:37 JST 2001	suz@sdl.hitachi.co.jp
	* kame/sys/netinet6/udp6_output.c, freebsd4/sys/netinet6/udp_usrreq.c:
	rejects IPv6 packet toward IPv4-mapped address if its source
	address is not an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address, since the
	converted IPv4 packets would have an unexpected IPv4 source 
	address.
	(TCP6 might have the same bug)

Wed Jul 25 15:33:06 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd/sys/net/route.c: do not fill rmx_mtu too much on RTM_ADD/
	  RTM_RESOLVE.  this was merged by mistake during past kame work.

2001-07-25  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/(various files): correctly supported
	interface-local multicast:
	- install ff01::%ifname/32 when first configuring an interface.
	- changed the source address selection for ff01::xxxx.
	- changed the outgoing interface selection for ff01::xxxx.
	- prohibit packets towards ff01::xxx from being sent on the wire.
	- reject packets towards ff01::xxxx from the wire.

Wed Jul 25 11:52:34 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet/if_gif.c: use encap_attach(), instead of
	  encap_attach_func().  enables us to use radix address match in
	  ip_encap.c.

Wed Jul 25 03:51:34 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet/ip_encap.c: use radix table lookup for entries registered
	  through encap_attach() API (address pairs).  still not sure if it
	  gives us any performance improvement, but should be much better
	  when you have thoudsands of gif interfaces.
	  
2001-07-24  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6.c (in6_control): in the SIOCDIFADDR_IN6
	case, if the corresponding prefix can be removed, just call
	prelist_remove(), not changing the expire value.

Tue Jul 24 17:54:10 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/in6_prefix.c: RIP.

2001-07-24  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/ping6/ping6.c: use bind(2) to specify the source
	address with the -S option.  (Unfortunately) IPV6_PKTINFO is not a
	good idea, because it cannot handle scoped addresses very well.

2001-07-24  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/raw_ip6.c (rip6_usrreq):
	* freebsd4/sys/netinet6/raw_ip6.c (rip6_bind):
	* freebsd4/sys/netinet6/raw_ip6.c (rip6_connect):
	supported the scoped address format in bind(2) and connect(2) for
	raw socket.  The former case is essential; bind(2) for a scoped
	address would not success without this fix.

Tue Jul 24 03:54:24 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/nd6.c: repair ndp -R.
	* ndp: do not print uninitialized interface on ndp -i.

Mon Jul 23 15:10:08 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/in6.c: now ff01::/16 prefix means "interface local
	  multicast", not "node local multicast".  therefore, we now
	  join ff01::1 in per-interface basis.  buggy.
	* *bsd*/usr.*/netstat/route.c: decode embedded scope identifier for
	  ff01::/16.   NOTE: we still are using IN6_IS_ADDR_MC_NODELOCAL macro,
	  as there's no "interface local" macro defined in 2553bis-03.

Mon Jul 23 00:28:05 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/net/radix_mpath.c: (netbsd, RADIX_MPATH) reject RTM_ADD of
	  conflicting entries, where all key/mask/gw are the same.

Sun Jul 22 11:07:17 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd/sys/netinet/in.c: improve IFA_ROUTE management, to make sure
	  multiple interface addresses with the same prefix (10.0.0.1/24 and
	  10.0.0.2/24) works right.  i bothered as it is mandatory with
	  RADIX_MPATH environment, and netbsd-current is moving toward this
	  direction.  netbsd only.
	  - on interface address addition, check if there's the same prefix
	    already installed, and if so, don't install another one
	  - on removal, check if there's other interface address which has the
	    same prefix, and if so, move IFA_ROUTE to him

Sat Jul 21 13:30:21 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/nd6_rtr.c: simplify default router list manipulation.
	  try to install multiple default routes into routing table, if
	  there are multiple RA sources (routers).

Sat Jul 21 03:35:20 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* *bsd*/sys/net/route.c: make equal() more pickier about sa_len,
	  to avoid possible data buffer overrun.
	* netbsd/sys/net/radix.c: multipath support in radix routing table.
	  experimental, netbsd only.  see 7.2 of IMPLEMENTATION.

Fri Jul 20 14:20:51 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* nodeinfod: a daemon that responds to node information queries.
	  we are wondering if it is a good idea to migrate to a userland
	  implementation, for complicated query type handling (like node
	  addresses, FQDN response with DNS encoding, NI group address,
	  and such).  we still find ping6 -w responses quite useful and
	  would like to keep it in the kernel (so that every node responds to).
	  or should we implement CDP? :-)  experimental.

2001-07-18  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/libinet6/getaddrinfo.c (getaddrinfo): enabled
	destination address reordering (that I introduced on July 3) by
	default, and removed the environment variable knob.

2001-07-18  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6.c (nd6_free): if the reason for the
	deletion is just garbage collection, and the neighbor is an active
	default router, do not delete it.  Instead, reset the GC timer
	using the router's lifetime.  Simply deleting the entry would
	affect default router selection, which is not necessarily a good
	thing, especially when we're using router preference values.

2001-07-18  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6_rtr.c (pfxlist_onlink_check): mark
	(autoconfigured) prefixes that do not have a reachable router when
	we have at least one default router (as well as the former
	condition).
	This change would help the case that we've moved to a new link where
	we have a router that does not provide prefixes and we configure
	an address by hand.

2001-07-18  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/contrib/bind/src/lib/resolv/res_init.c (res_setoptions):
	applied the fix below.

Wed Jul 18 18:06:25 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* libinet6/resolv/res_init.c: by putting "insecure1" or "insecure2"
	  into /etc/resolv.conf "options" line, you can control the
	  RES_INSECURE[12] settings in _res.options.

2001-07-18  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6.c (in6_createmkludge): was newly added
	to allocate space for the kludge at interface initialization time.
	Formerly, we dynamically allocated the space in in6_savemkludge()
	with malloc(M_WAITOK).  However, it was wrong since the function
	could be called under an interrupt context (software timer on
	address lifetime expiration).
	Although this function is a global one, it is expected to be
	called only from in6_ifattach().

Tue Jul 17 10:58:21 2001  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* freebsd4/sys/kern/kern_exec.c: applied the patch of 'FreeBSD

2001-07-16 Shin'ichi Fujisawa	<fujisawa@kame.net>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_dispatch.c (configCv4, configCv6):
	- configCv4() and configCv6() returns real payload number or

	- translate ICMPv6 Error Messages into ICMPv4.

2001-07-15  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6.c (in6_update_ifa): do not call malloc
	with M_WAITOK, since in6_update_ifa() can be called under an
	interrupt context.
	Based on a FreeBSD PR 28927 from Garrett Wollman
	<wollman@lcs.mit.edu> via ume.

Sun Jul 15 00:01:44 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/racoon:
	the time of execution of several cipher function and the taking time
	of each phase can be logged when ENABLE_STATS is defined.

Wed Jul 11 17:55:33 JST 2001	suz@sdl.hitachi.co.jp
	* kame/kame/pim6sd: added SSM (Source-Specific-Multicast) mode 
	  for SSM prefix (ff20::/12 and ff30::/12).
	  from Mickael Hoerdt <hoerdt@clarinet.u-strasbg.fr>.

	* bsdi4/sys/net/if_tun.c (tunifioctl): returned EAFNOSUPPORT if
	the SIOCSIFADDR command is issued for an unsupported address
	family (i.e. all AFs except AF_INET).  This helps the IPv6 layer
	detect the unavailability of the interface before going further on
	initialization, and, as a result, suppress unexpected warning
	messages.

Wed Jul  4 16:02:26 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* openbsd/usr.sbin/inetd/inetd.c: correct UDP source address checks.
	  2.9 code did not check it for IPv6 traffic.  sync with openbsd.

2001-07-03  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/libinet6/getaddrinfo.c: when the GAI_USE_ORDERING
	environment variable is set, reorder the chain that getaddrinfo(3)
	would return, based on the logic described in
	draft-ietf-ipngwg-default-addr-select.  With this extension,
	things would be happier when
	+ the underlying kernel supports IPv6,
	+ "the default interface" is specified by the "ndp -I" command,
	+ there is no router around the node,
	+ the destination node has both AAAA (or A6) and A resource
	  records, and
	+ the application just tries to connect to all the entries that
	  getaddrinfo(3) returns.
	XXX: items to be considered:
	- some of the logic is not implemented.
	- this routine opens a socket to get the corresponding source
	  address for each destination candidate.  This might cause
	  performance effect.
	
2001-07-03  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/sys/netinet/in_proto.c (inetsw[]): corrected the sysctl
	callback function for net.inet.ip6.XXX names (from icmp6_sysctl to
	ip6_sysctl).

Mon Jul  2 20:06:28 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/in6.c: record multicast groups joined from within the
	  kernel, into struct in6_ifaddr.  leave from these groups accordingly
	  on removal of interface addresses.
	* (netbsd) sys/netinet6/in6_pcb.c: remove multicast group information
	  from pcb, in the early stage of interface removal processing, in
	  in6_pcbpurgeif0().  without this change kernel may panic on pcmcia
	  card removal.  notified by jinmei.

<200106>
2001-06-29  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_forward.c (ip6_forward): do not drop the
	packet (nor send an icmp6 error) on a "p2p redirect" case, unless
	the packet's destination address is regarded as on-link.  With
	this check, we can distinguish a routing loop from a packet sent to
	a nonexistent address.  For the former case, we'd rather let the
	packet go to the loop, and detect the loop by traceroute.
	Clarification based on a recent discussion about the p2p-pingpong
	draft.

Thu Jun 28 21:56:12 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/libipsec/pfkey.c:
	Fixed to calculate the length of the sadb extension in the function
	pfkey_send_x5().  Calling pfkey_send_spddelete2() and
	pfkey_send_spdget() had a problem.  reported by <R.P.Koster@kpn.com>

Thu Jun 28 15:12:09 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* sys/netkey/key.c:
	the behavior of SPDUPDATE has been changed.  the kernel always add
	a new policy in the case of SPDUPDATE.  when there is a policy to be
	updated, the kernel will move the state of the policy to be dead, and
	then will add new policy.  hence, SPDUPDATE doesn't depend on whether
	there is a SP or not.

Thu Jun 28 10:23:01 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd/sys/netinet/udp_usrreq.c: correct UDP over IPv6 reception
	  when the packet is destined to a linklocal address.

Thu Jun 28 02:33:07 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/nd6.c: refresh default router list on nd6_detach(),
	  only if we are an autoconfigured host.  bug was that, we will lose
	  default route on "ifconfig gif0 destroy" even if default is not
	  pointing to gif0.  reported by ume@mahoroba.org.

Thu Jun 28 02:35:18 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/racoon:
	- fixed to set the inbound policy in the case of "generate_policy".
	- supported sadb_x_spdexpire().
	above two things are from <lab@gta.com>.

Thu Jun 28 02:33:32 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/setkey:
	enabled to use a service name as a port number.
	but these operation should use getaddrinfo().

Wed Jun 27 22:10:43 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* sys/netkey/key.c:
	* kame/libipsec/pfkey_dump.c:
	the lifetime information of the SP entry will send to the userland
	from the kernel through pfkey when of spddump.  And they can be
	displayed by setkey -DP.

Wed Jun 27 19:47:19 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* sys/net/pfkeyv2.h:
	* sys/netkey/key.c,key_debug.c:
	* kame/libipsec/pfkey_dump.c:
	* kame/setkey/scriptdump.pl:
	printed current sequence number of the SA.  accordingly, changed
	into sadb_x_sa2_sequence from sadb_x_sa2_reserved3 in the sadb_x_sa2
	structure.  Also the output of setkey is changed.  sequence number
	of the sadb is replaced to the end of the output.

Wed Jun 27 14:35:00 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* openbsd/sys/netinet/tcp_input.c: make faithd work on openbsd.
	  OpenBSD 2.9 has been working okay, this is KAME/openbsd29 issue.

Mon Jun 25 16:15:06 2001  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_fw.c: use syslog(3) interface for logging
	  from kuriyama@FreeBSD.org

Sat Jun 23 10:55:46 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* kame/mdnsd: with -N flag, mdnsd will lookup name-to-address mapping
	  using ICMPv6 node information query.  experimental.

Sat Jun 23 03:10:50 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c: disallow setsockopt(IPV6_V6ONLY)
	  for sockets that are already bound.  per discussions on ipngwg
	  mailing list.

2001-06-21 Shin'ichi Fujisawa	<fujisawa@kame.net>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_dispatch.c (foundFinalPayload):
	- Fix a bug that offset of the payload is calculated
	  incorrectly.	Apply a patch from <ubj@verkstad.net>.

2001-06-21  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/icmp6.c (icmp6_reflect): removed ifdef'ed
	blocks to keep an older rule about the size of icmp6 echo replies
	specified in rfc 1885, in order to make the code simpler.
	The history about the behavior was described as a comment just
	before the function definition.

2001-06-20  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/advapitest/sender.c:
	* kame/kame/ping6/ping6.c:
	removed IPV6_USE_MTU related parts.
	
2001-06-20  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/(several files): removed IPV6_USE_MTU related
	parts.  It was introduced as an experimental workaround on
	2000-11-28 (see CHANGELOG.2000), but we've found we do not need
	this stuff through further discussion (and implementation changes
	on the path MTU discovery procedure).

2001-06-20  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/icmp6.c (icmp6_reflect): set IPV6_MINMTU to
	avoid path MTU discovery for reflected packets.
	This might be controversial, but I believe this makes sense.

2001-06-20  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* freebsd4/sys/netinet/tcp_subr.c (tcp_rtlookup):
	* freebsd4/sys/netinet/tcp_subr.c (tcp_rtlookup6):
	made sure to use the correct sa_len for rtalloc().  sizeof(ro_dst)
	is not necessarily the correct one, especially in NEW_STRUCT_ROUTE
	cases for IPv6.
	The previous code could turn the path MTU discovery off as a bad
	effect.  If you define NEW_STRUCT_ROUTE in a KAME snap
	(note that GENERIC.KAME defines this option), be sure to update
	the kernel.

Wed Jun 20 14:33:28 2001  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/{in6_var.h,in6.c,natpt_rule.c,nd6_rtr.c}:
	  remove in6_len2mask(). this fucnction is duplicated with
	  in6_prefixlen2mask().

Tue Jun 19 16:33:40 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* bsdi4/sys/netinet/tcp_input.c: make faithd work on bsdi4.
	  reported by jinmei

2001-06-18 Shin'ichi Fujisawa	<fujisawa@kame.net>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_trans.c (translatingICMPv4To6):
	- Hop limit of translated IPv6 packet uses ttl of original
	  IPv4 packet, so that a hop limit is decremented in
	  ip6_forward().

	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_trans.c (tr_icmp4MimicPayload):
	- Correct UDP port number stored in ICMP_UNREACH packet
	  returned from IPv4 network.  It was not enough in the change
	  that I put in 09 Jun 2001.

	  Now, KAME NAT-PT can process traceroute6 from IPv6 host to
	  IPv4 host.

Mon Jun 18 16:59:35 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/icmp6.c: on icmp6 node information query (FQDN),
	  do not respond with hostnames with two dots (like "foo..bar").
	  0-length labels are not distinguishable with multiple name replies.
	  yoshfuji@usagi

2001-06-18  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6_rtr.c (in6_tmpifadd): called
	pfxlist_onlink_check() at the end of this function, to make sure
	a temporary address generated from a detached public one also
	detached.  This is redundant when the temporary address is
	generated when creating a new public address, but is essential
	when the address is generated due to deprecation of an old
	temporary address.

2001-06-17  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c: re-enabled clarification on the
	dependency between the 1st dst opt header and the routing header,
	based on rfc2292bis-02.
	This part was disabled when merging a recent mip6 patch from Ericsson,
	without much consideration about the rationale.  Actually,
	disabling this part just for MIP6 convenience is a bad idea (or at
	least not a good idea).  We need to think carefully about a way to
	make the advanced API coexist with MIP6 options.

Fri Jun 15 13:14:31 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* openbsd/sys/net/if.[ch]: change meaning of ifnet.if_lastchange
	  to meet with RFC1573 ifLastChange.  sync with openbsd-current.

Thu Jun 14 18:12:57 2001  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet/icmp6.h: 
          - add new types and codes defined in RFC3122(Inverse NDP). they
	    will be renamed when defined in 2292bis.
	  - duplicated KAME local types and codes are renumberd.

	  note that, for the following features, we have lost interoperability
	  between past KAME releases and future KAME releases (because they
	  use unofficial numbers).  if you play with these features, you must
	  upgrade all boxes you have.
	  - mtrace6(8)
	  - mobile-ip6 home agent discovery
	  - specific route information on RA, as defined in
	    draft-ietf-ipngwg-router-preference

Thu Jun 14 17:05:06 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd/sys/net/if.[ch]: change meaning of ifnet.if_lastchange
	  to meet with RFC1573 ifLastChange.  sync with netbsd-current.

Thu Jun 14 13:42:55 JST 2001	suz@sdl.hitachi.co.jp
	* bsdi3/usr.sbin/netstat/mroute6.c
	+ fixed a bug that bsdi3's "netstat -gn" does not display multicast 
	I/F list due to a lack of NEW_STRUCT_ROUTE macro.

Wed Jun 13 22:31:49 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* *bsd*/sys/net/if_ethersubr.c: in ether_input(), drop multicast packet
	  from myself, if the interface is !IFF_SIMPLEX.  multicast packets
	  are explicitly copied via loopback interface in ip_output() and
	  ip6_output(), so the old codepath caused a duplicate.  also the
	  old codepath affected IPv6 DAD.  KAME PR 360

Wed Jun 13 17:29:56 2001  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/net/if_gif.c: suppressed update of if_lastchange when
	processing packets on BSD/OS and FreeBSD for SNMP requirements.

2001-06-13  Shin'ichi Fujisawa	<fujisawa@kame.net>
	* sys/i386/conf/GENERIC.KAME
	- Add NATPT-NAT and add some notes.

	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_{defs.h,trans.c,tslot.c}
	- Support FTP4 non-passive mode.

	  You can connect IPv4 FTP client to IPv4 FTP server with
	  passive mode or non passive mode.  This is a part of
	  facility of NAT-PT.

	  If you want to use this facility (IPv4 NAT), it is necessary
	  to do uncomment of both following kernel options in
	  sys/i386/conf/GENERIC.KAME and compile/link kernel.

	    #options	NATPT
	    #options	NATPT_NAT

2001-06-10 Keiichi SHIMA <keiichi@iij.ad.jp>
	Remove MIP6 code from KAME source tree. MIP6 code is now
	under reconstruction. The last KAME snap that includes MIP6 is
	20010604 snap.

2001-06-09  Shin'ichi Fujisawa	<fujisawa@kame.net>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_trans.c (tr_icmp4MimicPayload):
	- Correct a packet header stored in a data part of returned
	  ICMP packet when ICMP_UNREACH returned from IPv4 network.
	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_{defs.h,trans.c,tslot.c}:
	- Remove NATPT_TRACEROUTE flag in struct _cv{}.
	  Does not use NATPT_TRACEROUTE by this modification.

Fri Jun  8 08:28:56 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net

2001-06-07  Shin'ichi Fujisawa	<fujisawa@kame.net>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_tslot.c (checkTracerouteReturn):
	- Translate incoming IPv4 ICMP_UNREACH packet when this
	  ICMP_UNREACH returns from IPv4 network, and it is a error
	  return for IPv6 host.	 Only return of traceroute was a
	  target until now.

	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_{dispatch.c,tslot.c,var.h}
	- Changed routine name as follows due to modification
	  mentioned above.
	    checkTracerouteReturn() -> checkIncomingICMP()

2001-06-07  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/ping6/ping6.c: stop sending echo packets whenever the
	upper limit is specified by the -c option, regardless of the -f
	option.  Based on a comment from Tomohide Nagashima
	<tomohide@japan-telecom.co.jp>.

Thu Jun  7 11:30:38 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* kame/racoon:
	fixed a segmentation fault when when racoon checks whether there is a
	phase 1 sa for phase 2 sa negotiation.

Mon Jun  4 22:45:23 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* openbsd: switch base version to 2.9.

Mon Jun  4 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* *bsd*/sys/net/rtsock.c: adjust routing socket message length
	  on route_output().  previous code may send up garbage at the end of
	  the message.
	* netbsd/sys/net/rtsock.c: check mbuf allocation failure in rt_msg1().

2001-06-03  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/rtadvd/config.c (getconfig): forced users to specify
	router lifetimes explicitly.  "rtltimeN" must now explicitly be
	specified.

2001-06-02  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/ndp/ndp.c (dump): skip routes with the LINK flag and
	a non AF_LINK gateway to suppress bark in getnbrinfo().
	XXX: such routes should have the GATEWAY flag, not the LINK flag.
	However, there is rotten routing software that advertises all
	routes that have the GATEWAY flag without careful examination.
	Thus, KAME kernel intentionally does not set the LINK flag.  What
	is to be fixed is not ndp, but such routing software (and the
	kernel workaround).

2001-06-01  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/icmp6.c (icmp6_reflect): used the default
	hoplimit value when rcvif is NULL.  Without the change, icmp6
	error packets would be sent with 0 hoplimit.
	All KAME snaps after the following change should be updated:
	Wed Apr  4 19:49:39 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net.

2001-06-01  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6.c (nd6_cache_lladdr): when the link-layer
	address of a router changes, select the best router again.  This
	is important especially when the neighbor entry is newly created,
	since it might make a new default router that is probably
	reachable, which affects the selection policy.

Fri Jun  1 00:44:00 JST 2001 sakane@kame.net
	* sys/netkey/key.c:
	Fixed to make a response in key_spdadd().

2001-05-31  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/libinet6/getaddrinfo.c (explore_numeric): when a
	numeric address is given to getaddrinfo() with the AI_CANONNAME
	flag, set the name itself to each ai_canonname field of the
	returned addrinfo chain.
	Without the change, getaddrinfo would leave the field NULL, which

Thu May 24 18:18:24 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* kame/racoon:
	Enabled passive mode.  Racoon never initiate IKE session
	if passive mode is defined in the configuration file.

Thu May 24 17:59:51 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* sys/netkey/key.c:

2001-05-21  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* {kame,*bsd}/sys/netinet{,6}/many files: added complete support

	- it now prohibits the outbound direction as well as inbound.
	- it considers the cases where the option is specified for an already
	  bound, connected, or listening socket.
	- it works for bsdi4 as well as for other BSDs (except OpenBSD).

2001-05-21  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_input.c (ip6_input): in the 'goto ours'
	check, do not accept packet if the corresponding route has the
	cloned bit.  This fix should solve the problem that some OSes
	mistakenly accept a packet to fe80::2%lo0.
	XXX: the added check is not intuitive, and I'm not 100% sure this
	change will never introduce another kind of problem.  We might
	reconsidr to solve the problem in a more explicit manner.
	The fix was based on a report from Hajimu UMEMOTO
	<ume@mahoroba.org>.

Fri May 18 17:10:10 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* kame/racoon:
	Fixed to copy "reqid" into a proposal table from policy entries.
	The exchange failed when policy level "unique" was specified.

Fri May 18 14:50:56 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* kame/setkey:
	Enabled to get a protocol number from /etc/protocol as upper layer
	protocol.  "icmp6" and "ip4" still can be used.

2001-05-17  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/frag6.c (frag6_input): plugged memory leak in
	overlapping fragments cases.
	Suggested by hitachi guys via sumikawa@kame.net.

Thu May 17 12:50:40 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6: remove OLDIP6OUTPUT codepath.  notified from sumikawa
	  (i remember i said i would do this, a long time ago)

Wed May 16 12:04:57 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* sys/netinet6/ah_input.c:
	don't flip ip_id *back* in freebsd4.x case.
	reported by <ume@mahoroba.org>.

Mon May 14 23:01:30 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet/in_gif.c, sys/netinet6/in6_gif.c: drop IFF_LINK0
	  (multi destination mode) support.

Mon May 14 00:42:52 JST 2001	suz@sdl.hitachi.co.jp
	* kame/kame/mld6query/mld6.c: fixed a bug in argument handling.
	from Mickael Hoerdt <hoerdt@clarinet.u-strasbg.fr>

2001-05-13  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/INSTALL: added a note about ppp.diff
	based on a comment from <murakami@pana.net>.

2001-05-10  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/usr.bin/telnet/commands.c (tn): corrected a loop for
	connect(2) after getaddrinfo(3).
	The fix was from <murakami@pana.net>

Wed May  9 20:15:22 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* ping6/ping6.c: correct signal handling with
	  "ping6 -f <nonexisting peer>".  from hash@iij.ad.jp.

2001-05-07  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/bindtest: added supplement tests to see which sockets
	receive which packets.
	Two new option -1 and -2 were added to support TCP cases of the
	above test.
	Another new option -6 was also added to support the IPV6_V6ONLY
	option if available.
	* kame/kame/bindtest/test.sh: added new tests based on the above
	enhancement.

2001-05-07  Shin'ichi Fujisawa  <fujisawa@kame.net>
	* sys/netinet6/natpt_{defs.h,trans.c}
	  Support EPSV command/response pair to/from PASV command/respons
	  translation.  You can use ftp from IPv6 client to IPv4 ftp
	  server, if it is passive mode.

2001-05-05  Shin'ichi Fujisawa  <fujisawa@kame.net>
	* sys/netinet6/natpt_{log,trans}.c
	  Remove warning in compilation.

2001-05-05  Shin'ichi Fujisawa  <fujisawa@kame.net>
	* sys/netinet6/natpt_*.[ch]
	* kame/natptconfig/*.[chly]
	- Remove the code which considered FAITH.
	  This facility is not thought about well.  If there is need, we had
	  better reconsider this.

Wed May  2 16:30:34 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* kame/racoon:
	- logged the openssl version when racoon starts.
	- fixed to check whether to process the pfkey message received.
	  moved the routine into each pfkey handler.

2001-05-01  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* freebsd4/sys/net/if.c (if_detach): reversed the order of
	in6_ifdetach and rnh_walktree(if_rtdel).  Since IPv6 interface direct
	routes are expected to be removed by the IPv6-specific kernel API,
	the old order would cause some inconsistency between the routing
	entries and IPv6 specific data structures.

Wed May  2 02:01:25 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netkey/key.c: correct varaible initialization in inbound
	  tunnel policy checking.  From: Gunther Schadow

Tue May  1 16:49:24 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ip6_forward.c: turn on PROHIBIT_P2PREDIRECT by default,
	  based on discussion on ipngwg mailing list.  see changelog on
	  sep 12 2000 by jinmei@kame.net

<200104>
Sun Apr 29 12:25:48 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/raw_ip6.c (except freebsd[34]): plug mbuf leak on
	  sysctl(IPV6_CHECKSUM).

Sat Apr 28 00:09:10 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/nd6.c (freebsd): repair backward binary compatibility
	  breakage for SIOCGIFINFO_IN6.
	  see changelog on Sat Feb 17 01:51:43 JST 2001.
	  if you are on freebsd systems please make sure to recompile
	  /usr/local/v6/sbin/ndp with the new header files.
	  /usr/sbin/ndp should work fine with the latest kernel.

Fri Apr 27 17:53:54 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/in6.c:in6_ifinit(): make it work with stf interface.
	  initialize ia_addr before if_ioctl(SIOCSIFADDR), to meet historical
	  practice in in_ifinit().
	* sys/net/if_stf.c: pickup a correct outer IPv4 destination address,
	  even if the gateway portion on the routing table is set to non-6to4
	  address, like:
	  # route add -inet6 2002:: -prefixlen 16 ::1 -ifp stf0
	* netbsd/sbin/ifconfig/ifconfig.c: allow "deprecated" flag to be
	  set by user.  it is useful to configure outgoing-only stf interface,
	  like:
	  # ifconfig stf0 inet6 2002:d2a0:5f68::1 prefixlen 16 alias deprecated 
	* sys/net/if_stf.c: IFF_LINK0 disables the input path.

2001-04-27  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6.c (nd6_rtrequest): stop process if
	nd6_need_cache() is 0 and the route is not a host route (which
	should probably be an interface direct route on a link that does
	not need neighbor cahces).  Otherwise, the function would set the
	RTF_LLINFO flag, which would annoy the ndp(8) command.

	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6_rtr.c (nd6_prefix_onlink): did not set
	the RTF_GATEWAY flag even for !nd6_need_cache() cases.  The
	intention was to prevent the process of nd6_rtrequest(), but we do
	not need the flag, since we now explicitly disable the process.
	Setting the RTF_GATEWAY flag is not the best way, because routes
	with the flag can mistakenly be deleted by user applications.
	
Tue Apr 24 15:29:51 2001  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* freebsd4: sync with 4.3-RELEASE

Fri Apr 20 23:59:21 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/in6_pcb.c: (netbsd): fix #if clause with NOIPPRIVPORTS.
	  the old code mistakenly allowed bind(2) from non-privileged user
	  onto privilege ports (netbsd integrated trees, like plain NetBSD 1.5
	  are not affected).  from k-sugyou.
	  
Thu Apr 19 18:26:49 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* sys/netinet6/ah_input.c:
	Fixed to mismatch AH checksum on FreeBSD4.  ip->ip_id was reversed
	before calculating IPv4 ah checksum, but this operation is not
	necessary for FreeBSD4.  Only FreeBSD[23], openbsd and bsdi3 need.
	The problem doesn't appear on the FreeBSD original tree.

2001-04-18  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/pim6[ds]d/mld6_proto.c: clarifications and cleanups;
	  - removed an incorrect check in accept_listener_query(), which was
	    rather harmful.
	  - ignore queries if the receiving node is the querier.
	  - removed a redundant check in accept_listener_query().
	  - removed the al_old member of the listaddr structure, and all
	    references to the member.  This should be safe, because there
	    is effectively no use of the member.  This change should also
	    make the code more conformant to RFC 2710.
	  All the changes were based on comments from Mickael Hoerdt
	  <hoerdt@clarinet.u-strasbg.fr>.
	
Sun Apr 15 14:38:58 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ipsec.c: on IPsec tunnel mode encapsulation, do not
	  copy TTL (or hop limit) value from inner to outer IP header.
	  From: Ronald.vanderPol@surfnet.nl

Wed Apr 11 18:52:26 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* racoon:
	Supported to get a certificate from DNS CERT RR.
	Also getcertsbyname() is implemented In order to get CERT RRs.
	This function can use lwres.a if HAVE_LWRES is defined when racoon
	is compiled.
	XXX need more local test and interoperability test.
	XXX should be arranged too many certificate stuff in racoon.conf.

2001-04-11  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c (ip6_pcbopt):
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c (ip6_setpktoptions):
	prevented invalid (anycast or unready) addresses from being
	specified as the packet's source address using the IPV6_PKTINFO
	socket option or ancillary data.

2001-04-10  Jason R. Thorpe  <thorpej@zembu.com>

	* racoon/pfkey.c: pk_recvacquire(): Make sure the phase1
	and phase2 handlers are unbound before the phase 2 handler
	is deleted.
	* racoon/isakmp.c: ph1_main(), quick_main(): Add the message
	to the received-list before processing to ensure the packet
	isn't processed twice in case of an error.
	isakmp_post_acquire(): Don't unbind the phase1/phase2 handlers;
	let the caller do it.
	isakmp_newcookie(): Plug memory leaks.
	From George Yang <gyang@zembu.com>.
	* racoon/ipsec_doi.c: get_ph2approvalx(): When we find a
	matching saprop, make sure to flushsaprop(pr0), as the returned
	saprop is a copy.  Fixes a memory leak.
	From George Yang <gyang@zembu.com>.
	* racoon/isakmp_quick.c: quick_r2send(): Make sure to vfree(data)
	if we fail to allocate a new body.  Fixes a memory leak.
	From George Yang <gyang@zembu.com>.

Tue Apr 10 22:51:26 JST 2001	suz@sdl.hitachi.co.jp
	* rtadvd/config.c, rtadvd/rtadvd.h, rtadvd/rtadvd.conf.5
	you can advertise route information option as stated in 
	draft-draves-ipng-router-selection-01.txt.

	* sys/netinet/icmp6.h (nd_opt_route_info, ND_OPT_ROUTE_INFO)
	* kame/sys/netinet/icmp6.h added a macro and a structure 
	for route information option.
	Note that these are still non-standard.

	Note: before compiling the latest rtadvd, you have to install the
	header file, and (probably) perform "make clean".
	
2001-04-07  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/sys/netinet/in_proto.c (inetsw[]): set ipsec_sysctl
	correctly.  Without this, "netstat -p ipsec -s" does not work.

2001-04-07  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/sys/netinet/tcp_input.c (tcp_peer_mss): avoided
	IPv6 fragmentation when IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU is required.

Fri Apr  6 23:25:19 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* racoon:
	implemented to generate the policy in the responder side automatically.
	If the responder does not have any policy in SPD during phase 2
	negotiation, and the directive is set on, then racoon will choice
	the first proposal in the SA payload from the initiator, and generate
	policy entries from the proposal.  This function is for the responder,
	and ignored in the initiator case.
	XXX should be checked tunnel mode case.

2001-04-04  Jason R. Thorpe  <thorpej@zembu.com>

	* racoon: Add support for the Dmalloc debugging malloc
	library.  This library gives very nice memory usage
	statistics and leak information.

Thu Apr  5 03:42:24 JST 2001	suz@sdl.hitachi.co.jp
	* kame/v6test/getconfig.c: v6test supports arbitrary raw packet 
	advertisement, such as OSPFv3, Tunnelled packet etc.

Wed Apr  4 22:47:27 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* racoon:
	support scopeid.  base code was from <Francis.Dupont@enst-bretagne.fr>.
	it should be considered more.

Wed Apr  4 19:49:39 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/icmp6.c: make sure we do not pass mbuf with 
	  bogus m->m_pkthdr.rcvif, to icmp6_reflect(), on icmp6 error
	  generation.

Wed Apr  4 13:17:00 JST 2001	suz@sdl.hitachi.co.jp
	* kame/v6test/getconfig.c
	fixed a bug that you cannot specify an optional value if its 
	MSB is on.

2001-04-03  Jason R. Thorpe  <thorpej@zembu.com>

	* racoon: Better integration of debugging malloc libraries.
	Use wrapper macros (racoon_{malloc,calloc,free,realloc}())
	so that debugging malloc implementations can get file/line
	info, and also put traditional malloc/calloc/free/realloc
	stubs in the main program so that libraries linked with
	racoon get the debugging allocators, as well.

Mon Apr  3 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/tcp6_output.c (freebsd2/bsdi3),
	  sys/netinet/tcp_output.c (netbsd/openbsd/bsdi4):
	  support IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU setsockopt on IPv6 tcp.
	  - pass IPV6_MINMTU down to ip6_output,
	  - on outgoing segment packing use 1280 (IPV6_MMTU) as packet size,
	    instead of MSS heard from the peer (except bsdi4/openbsd).

	  design memo:
	  do we need to play with MSS advertisement to the peer?  I don't
	  think so, since:
	  - IPV6_MIN_MTU controls outbound traffic only
	  - outgoing MSS advertisement will control the inbound segment size.
	  though i agree that it is be useful to decrase MSS advertisement
	  to trick inbound PMTUD behavior, i believe it is a separate topic
	  from IPV6_MIN_MTU.

	  TODO: generate packets fit into 1280 bytes for bsdi4/openbsd

2001-04-02  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi3/sys/net/if.c (ifa_ifwithnet): disabled the check for
	IFF_POINTOPOINT|IFF_LOOPBACK in ifa_ifwithnet().  The check for
	IFF_POINTOPOINT was already disabled, but the check for
	IFF_LOOPBACK should be disabled as well, in order to install
	fe80::%lo0/64 correctly.

2001-04-01  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_input.c (ip6_input): clarified goto-ours
	logic:
	1. separated checks against spoofed ::1 src/dst from the goto-ours
	check.  This also fixed a bug that the kernel accepted a packet with
	src=::1, dst=invalid (not assigned), rcvif=lo0
        (you can test it by 'ping6 -S ::1 fe80::xxxx%lo0", where xxxx is
	not an interface ID of lo0)
	2. omitted a special case for link-local destinations on a
	loopback interface, because
        - we now have a host route for fe80::1%lo0, so we can accept a
	  packet to the address using the generic logic.
	- we can reject packets to fe80::xxxx%lo0 (xxxx != 1) by the check
	  for the RTF_GATEWAY bit for rt_flags (ip6_input.c line 872).

<200103>
Fri Mar 30 10:46:00 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/nd6_rtr.c: repair inbound RA processing.  broken
	  yesterday (with mobile-ip6 commit).

2001-03-29  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6.h (IN6_IS_ADDR_xxx): made the macros safe
	to the gcc's -Wcast-qual option.
	Based on a comment from Brian Wellington
	<Brian.Wellington@nominum.com>.

Thu Mar 29 16:31:34 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/mip6*: bring in latest ericsson mobile-ip6 code.
	  based on revision 13 of the mobile-ip6 draft.  see TODO.mobile-ip6
	  for details.

2001-03-26  Jason R. Thorpe  <thorpej@zembu.com>
	* racoon/isakmp_ident.c: ident_ir2sendmx(): plug memory
	  leak -- gsstoken wasn't being freed at function exit.

2001-03-26  Jason R. Thorpe  <thorpej@zembu.com>
	* racoon: Changes to Vendor ID payload handling.  Determine
	  which VID we will send on a per-proposal basis; we may need
	  to send a different one for each proposal depending on the
	  proposal contents (e.g. GSSAPI auth method).  We no longer
	  set the Vendor ID in the localconf.

	  When matching the Vendor ID in check_vendorid(), use a table
	  of known Vendor IDs, and return the index, and maintain a list
	  of extensions that vendors implement (e.g. GSSAPI auth method).
	  XXX We have a slight hack to recognize the Windows 2000 Vendor
	  ID.  Need to clarify with the Microsoft IPsec guys.

	  In Aggressive Mode, as responder, when sending first
	  response, make sure to include a Vendor ID payload.

	  In Main Mode, as responder, when sending first response,
	  make sure to include a Vendor ID payload.

	  XXX Still more Vendor ID processing fixes to go.  And
	  GSSAPI auth doesn't interoperate with Windows 2000 yet.

Sun Mar 25 18:11:24 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/{ip6_mroute,in6_prefix}.c: add missing splx.
	  From: csapuntz@play-doh.stanford.edu (Constantine Sapuntzakis)
	* sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c: correct dangling pointer in jumbogram
	  output logic.
	  From: csapuntz@play-doh.stanford.edu (Constantine Sapuntzakis)

2001-03-23  Shin'ichi Fujisawa  <fujisawa@kame.net>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_*.[ch]
	- Change MALLOC type M_TEMP to M_NATPT.
	  This causes serious memory leak in FreeBSD4.2 when leave M_TEMP.

2001-03-23  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/icmp6.c (ni6_addrs, ni6_store_addrs):
	If the 3rd bit of the icmp6_nodeinfo sysctl variable is clear,
	- do not respond to node info FQDN to an RFC3041 temporary address.
	- do not include temporary addresses in a node info Node Addresses
	  reply.
	This bit is clear by default based on privacy consideration.

Thu Mar 22 08:06:30 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* racoon:
	fixed to parse modp1536 of DH group. reported by <shigeru@iij.ad.jp>

2001-03-22  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6.c (nd6_cache_lladdr): set nd6_gctimer to
	ln_expire just after the state transition to STALE.  This change
	fixed a bug that a longer timer value was mistakenly set, after
	transition to the delay ND state.  The bug could delay NUD, but it
	does not happen in a normal operation.  Thus, you do not
	necessarily have to update the kernel in a hurry.

	The bug was introduced around Jan 20th, 2001, and was found by a
	recent TAHI conformance check.

Thu Mar 22 04:56:57 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* racoon/policy.c:
	fixed to compare between policies when the responder decides to
	accept the proposal or not.  the upper layer protocol is represented
	by 0 in ID payload.

Thu Mar 22 04:15:43 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ip6_input.c (netbsd): inject packet to ipfilter
	  only if it is wire format (not if it went through ipsec tunnel).
	  http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/network/ipsec/#ipf-interaction

2001-03-22  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/rtadvd/config.c (getconfig): allow router preference
	values to be specified in the "raflags" directive.
	* kame/sys/netinet/icmp6.h (ND_RA_RTPREF_xxx): added definitions
	for router preferences.  Note that these are non-standard.

	Note: before compiling the latest rtadvd, you have to install the
	header file, and (probably) perform "make clean".

Thu Mar 22 01:45:32 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* racoon:
	fixed potencial of a buffer overrun when adding a ID payload to
	the ISAKMP payload.  It happened when policy is both to use IPSec
	transport mode and not to specify a transport protocol.
	reported by <cs@purdue.edu>.

Thu Mar 22 00:26:51 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/icmp6.c: update MTU on path MTU timeout.
	  noted by onoe@sm.sony.co.jp.
	* ndp/ndp.c: do not dereference null pointer.  from tomomi suzuki

2001-03-20  Shin'ichi Fujisawa  <shin@loquat.rant.net>
	* sys/netinet6/natpt_trans.c: Put IPPROTO_UDP into IPv6 header.
	  Because conversion of IP header part is shared with TCP, default
	  protocol was set as TCP.
	* sys/netinet6/natpt_trans.c: Calculate UDP checksum which was
	  converted to IPv6.  I forgot to re-calculate it.

Tue Mar 20 11:56:08 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/icmp6.c: change interpretation of
	  net.inet6.icmp6.nodeinfo from true/false to bitmap.
	  2^0 (= 1) bit: respond/ignore FQDN query (ping6 -w)
	  2^1 (= 2) bit: respond/ignore NODEINFO query (ping6 -a)

2001-03-19  Shin'ichi Fujisawa  <shin@dianthus.kame.net>
	* Add initial version of NAT-PT plan.

2001-03-18  Shin'ichi Fujisawa  <fujisawa@kame.net>
	* freebsd4/sys/netinet/ip_input.c 
	  - Move NATPT hook to just before check to see if the packet is
	    for us.  Because NATPT need one more extra IPv4 address to
	    translate IPv6 to IPv4 when this NATPT hook was put after this
	    inspection.
	  - Change indent to an 8 character tab.
	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_dispatch.c 
	  - Add IPv6 outbound packet counter.
	  - Fix bug of comparison that size of packet exceeds mtu.
	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_trans.c 
	  - Fix a bug to clear UDP header when calculate UDP checksum.
	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt_{defs.h,dispatch.c,tslot.c}
	  - Remove code evading a bug of SuMiRe NAT.
	    SuMiRe NAT is obsolete.

Thu Mar 15 20:39:03 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* racoon:
	- fixed a phase 2 handler deletion.  racoon will delete a phase2
	  handler immediately when hard lifetime expires.
	- check a unit of the timer in the configuration file.

Thu Mar 15 17:48:54 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet/ip_mroute.c: use sys/netinet/ip_encap.c framework
	  for inbound packet dispatch.

2001-03-15  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6.c (in6_ifinit): always set nd6_rtrequest
	to ifa_rtrequest.
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6_rtr.c (nd6_prefix_onlink): because of the
	above change, the function does not set the ifa_rtrequest
	function.
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6.c (in6_ifloop_request): set the address
	itself as gateway, and set the corresponding host route to the
	RTF_LLINFO, so that the route would have the flag, and thus
	applications (e.g. routing daemons) that assume traditional kernel
	behavior would be happy.  Older versions made the route to the
	node's own address like this:
	2001:200::3ca2:ffef:eff5:f9fd ::1  UH lo0
	However, since some routing daemons try to install kernel internal
	routes that do not have the RTF_LLINFO flag, this kind of entry
	could cause unintentional host routes propagated.  The new kernel,
	instead, installs
	2001:200::c049:d099:ab4b:b637 0:a0:12:34:ab:cd UHL lo0
	just like far older versions of the kernel (except for the
	existance of the cloned bit), which installed the host route as a
	cloned route from the corresponding interface direct route.

2001-03-13  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* freebsd2/ports/wu-ftpd: upgraded to wu-ftpd 2.6.1.  Since there
	are security holes in older versions, upgrade is recommended.

Mon Mar 12 20:17:43 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/crypto/sha2/sha2.c: hmac-sha2-{256,384,512} support.  attaches
	  96 bits of crypto checksum (not sure if this is right - there's no
	  draft on this).
	  TODO: interop tests

2001-03-11  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c (ip6_output): added a couple of
	missing splx() for OpenBSD IPsec.

2001-03-08  Atsushi Onoe <onoe@sm.sony.co.jp>
	* kame/route6d.c: correct deleting host route, based on
	report from enami@sm.sony.co.jp.

2001-03-06  Jason R. Thorpe  <thorpej@zembu.com>

	* kame/racoon/schedule.c: Implement sched_scrub_param(),
	which kills all scheduler work queue entries which a
	specified parameter.
	* kame/racoon/handler.c: Use sched_scrub_param() to make
	sure no references to a handler exist when it is freed.

2001-03-06  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6_rtr.c (nd6_prefix_onlink): set RTF_GATEWAY
	to an interface direct route when nd6_need_cache() is false, in
	order to prevent nd6_rtrequest() from setting RTF_LLINFO (which
	annoys the ndp(8) command).
	This change is based on a report from nobumichi ozoe
	<nobumichi_ozoe@ydc.co.jp>.

Tue Mar  6 09:22:56 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/raw_ip6.c: permit IPV6_CHECKSUM socket option for
	  the following cases only (previously it was allowed for any AF_INET6
	  socket): raw ip6 socket, and protocol != IPPROTO_ICMPV6.
	  RFC2292 section 3.1.  commented by yoshfuji.

2001-03-05  Jason R. Thorpe  <thorpej@zembu.com>

	* kame/racoon/gssapi.c: Use GSS_C_MECH_CODE when reporting
	GSSAPI errors.

2001-03-05  Jason R. Thorpe  <thorpej@zembu.com>

	* kame/racoon/handler.c: Implement deleteallph2(), which
	deletes all Phase 2 handlers for a given src/dst/proto.
	* kame/racoon/isakmp_inf.c: When processing INITIAL-CONTACT,
	try to use the SADB_DELETE `delete all' extension and
	deleteallph2() before doing it The Hard Way.  For both The
	Easy Way and The Hard Way, make sure we only delete SAD entries
	for SATYPEs that we manage.
	* kame/racoon/pfkey.c: Use a table of SATYPEs that we manage,
	and use that table to initialize our PF_KEY state.

2001-03-05  Jason R. Thorpe  <thorpej@zembu.com>

	* kame/libipsec/pfkey.c: Add pfkey_send_delete_all(), which
	sends an SADB_DELETE with satype/mode/src/dst.

Mon Mar  5 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/raw_ip6.c: avoid 1-byte mbuf buffer overrun, and/or
	  unaligned memory access, in rip6_output().  commented by yoshfuji.
	  it will be tickled only if a evil/buggy root process runs.

2001-03-04  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6.c (nd6_free): moved a line calling
	pfxlist_onlink_check() before the default router selection part,
	based on a request from Mattias Pettersson
	<mattias.pettersson@verkstad.net>.

2001-03-03  Shin'ichi Fujisawa  <fujisawa@kame.net>
	* kame/pma/*: removed.
	  This function is obsolete.

2001-03-03  Shin'ichi Fujisawa  <fujisawa@kame.net>
	* sys/netinet6/natpt_usrreq.c (natpt_uattach) call natpt_attach if
	  privileged process.
	* sys/netinet6/natpt_rule.c (natpt_in4_len2mask): convert host
	  byte order of calculated mask.
	* sys/conf/options (freebsd4): add NATPT_NAT
	* kame/natptconfig/show.c: Fix struct nlist symbol name.  Change
	  string compare method, check string length in the first place.

	  TODO: It is not so good to read '/dev/kmem', I need to think about
	  another method to read these variables from kernel.

2001-03-02  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6_rtr.c (prelist_update): clarified the
	update routine for an existing prefix.  It now tries to update
	some parameters even if the L bit is zero.  This would be
	necessary for the case where a router first advertises the prefix
	without the L bit being set, and next the same prefix with the bit
	being set.

Fri Mar  2 20:05:23 2001  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* netbsd/usr.bin/tftp/main.c: port checking fix.
	  from h-yamamo@db3.so-net.ne.jp.

Fri Mar  2 16:11:17 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/crypto/{twofish,rijndael}: change key initialization API to
	  pass binary keys instead of hexadecimal string keys.

Fri Mar  2 01:48:24 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet/ip_input.c (all *bsd): drop packets from outside
	  if these contain 127/8 in ip_src or ip_dst.

Thu Mar  1 20:01:14 JST 2001	suz@sdl.hitachi.co.jp
	* bsdi3/sys/netinet/raw_ip.c
	fixed a bug that bsdi3 KAME with IPsec crashes when it receives 	
	an ICMP packet

Thu Mar  1 18:28:48 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet/ip_input.c, sys/netinet6/ip6_input.c (except openbsd):
	  enforce inbound policy match on all final protocol headers.
	  previously, inbound policy is enforced only for udp/tcp/icmp.
	  basically the fix is for transport mode case.
	  XXX ipsec policy engine still needs a great amount of updates.
	* freebsd4/sys/netinet/in_proto.c: add ipcomp input support.

<200102>
Wed Feb 28 23:26:26 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/esp_output.c: support random length padding in ESP,
	  to avoid traffic analysis on short packets.  by setting
	  net.inet.ipsec.esp_randpad (or net.inet6.ipsec6.esp_randpad) to
	  positive value N, you can ask the kernel to randomly pad packets
	  shorter than N bytes, to random length smaller than or equal to N.
	  note that N does not include ESP authentication data length.
	  also note that the random padding is not included in TCP segment
	  size computation.

	  recommeded value for N is like 128, or 256 (if you use a too big
	  number as N, you may experience inefficiency due to fragmented
	  packets).

Mon Feb 26 22:53:02 2001  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* sys/netinet6/nd6.c : do not overwrite llcache if static ndp is
	  set

Mon Feb 26 18:21:08 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ip6_{in,out}put.c: support 2553bis-03 IPV6_V6ONLY
	  socket option (not finished yet).
	  (1) supply net.inet6.ip6.v6only on all platforms.  it shows the
	  kernel default behavior for IPV6_V6ONLY socket option.  mutable
	  on netbsd/freebsd3/freebsd4, immutable on other platforms.
	  (2) support IPV6_V6ONLY on all platforms.  on netbsd/freebsd3/
	  freebsd4, the socket option is mutable and has per-socket state.
	  on other platforms, we can only read it (you can set it if the
	  value is same as the default - non-changeable - behavior).

	  TODO: synchronize AF_INET6 socket behavior with 2553bis-03, from
	  IPV6_V6ONLY POV (at least netbsd does not meet 2553bis-03, as the
	  socket option controls inbound only, should control both inbound
	  and outbound).  *bsd have their own preference on kernel default
	  behavior due to security risks, so will change that.

	  NOTE: netbsd IPV6_BINDV6ONLY is now obsoleted.  old binaries should
	  just work (IPV6_V6ONLY uses same socket option # as IPV6_BINDV6ONLY).
	  NOTE: freebsd net.inet6.ip6.mapped_addr is obsoleted.

Mon Feb 26 15:36:51 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet*/raw*.c: validate inbound IPsec policy on raw socket
	  processing.  from: kalyan@juniper.net

2001-02-25  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6.c (nd6_need_cache): separated from
	nd6_output() to decide whether to make a neighbor cache entry for
	the link of a given interface.  This function is (currently)
	called from nd6_output() and nd6_prefix_onlink(), and make the
	decision policy consistent.
	Based on the current policy, we do not make a neighbor cache for a
	loopback link, in response to a comment from Miyata-san@YDC.

Thu Feb 22 10:08:27 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* racoon:
	fixed to check the outbound policy when the responder received the
	1st packet in phase 2.  the tunnel mode and the transport specified
	the pair of IP addresses of the end of the SA had failed.

Thu Feb 22 01:59:01 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/{dest6,nd6}.c: make variable length header parsing
	  pickier (= safer).
	* sys/netinet6/frag6.c: fix behavior on memory shortage/too many
	  reass queues.
	* openbsd/include/netdb.h: change ai_addrlen from int to socklen_t,
	  to conform to 2553bis-03.

Wed Feb 21 14:25:55 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* racoon:
	changed the proposal order of the protocol in the phase 2.
	If we want to make a packet "IP2 AH ESP IP1 ULP", the SPD in KAME
	expresses AH transport + ESP tunnel.  racoon sent the proposal
	contained such the order.  But lots of implementation interprets
	AH tunnel + ESP tunnel in this case.  racoon changes the order,
	and usually uses this format.  If the option, 'complex_bundle'
	is enable, racoon uses old format.

Wed Feb 21 13:04:17 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* openbsd/usr.sbin/pim6{sd,dd}: compile these on openbsd.
	  not really tested.

Wed Feb 21 13:00:00 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ah_{core,output}.c: one more correction to IPv4 option
	  chasing in AH processing.

Mon Feb 19 20:51:41 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ipsec.c (netbsd only): correct severe memory leak
	  in ipsec operation.  the bug was introduced on 2/14/2001.

Mon Feb 19 15:03:24 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ah_{core,output}.c: correct IPv4 option chasing in
	  AH processing.  the change is important if you use IPsec.

Mon Feb 19 11:49:29 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd/usr.sbin/pppd: sync with 1.5 tree.

2001-02-19  Shin'ichi Fujisawa  <fujisawa@kame.net>
	* freebsd4/sys/netinet/ip_input.c: Add a NATPT hook into ip_input().
	* freebsd4/sys/netinet/ip_proto.c: Add a NATPT entry into struct
	  ipprotosw inetsw[].
	* sys/netinet6/ip6_input.c: include "opt_natpt.h" when FreeBSD
	  version is more than 3.

	  Sorry, there is a problem a little, and NATPT does not work yet.

2001-02-16  Jason R. Thorpe  <thorpej@zembu.com>
	* sys/netkey/key.c: When processing an SADB_DELETE message,
	  allow SADB_EXT_SA to be blank.  In this case, we delete
	  all non-LARVAL SAs that match the src/dst/protocol.  This
	  is particularly useful in IKE INITIAL-CONTACT processing.
	  Idea from Bill Sommerfeld <sommerfeld@east.sun.com>, who
	  implemented it in post-Solaris8.
	* kame/setkey/parse.y, kame/setkey/token.l,
	  kame/setkey/setkey.8: Add a "deleteall" command that takes
	  a src/dst/protocol.

Sat Feb 17 01:51:43 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/nd6.c: recover backward binary compatibility for
	  SIOCGIFINFO_IN6.
	* openbsd/sys/netinet/udp_usrreq.c: remove IPv6 cases from udp_output()
	  to simplify it and make it easier to audit it (sync with openbsd-
	  current).

Wed Feb 14 17:37:34 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/kern/uipc_mbuf2.c: make sure to return non-shared mbuf on
	  calls to m_pulldown().

Wed Feb 14 16:27:49 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ip6_input.c: merge mbuf data into single mbuf, if
	  mbuf chain is passed to ip6_input.  it makes IPv6 packet processed
	  okay when L2 code passes non-continuous mbuf data (like L2 bridge
	  code).  affects freebsd[234] and bsdi[34] only.

Tue Feb 13 18:42:17 2001  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* freebsd4/sys/{if_sppp.h,if_spppsubr.c}: supported PPPv6 for
	  kernel level PPP.

2001-02-11  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6.c (in6if_do_dad): was added to centralize
	the decision of whether DAD should be performed on a particular
	interface.  This function is currently called from
	in6_update_ifa() and in6_ifattach_linklocal().

2001-02-09  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6_ifattach.c (in6_ifattach): skipped
	assignment of link-local addresses when interfaces become up,
	if ip6_auto_linklocal is 0 (its default is 1).  By setting this
	variable to 0 and manually configuring link-local addresses, you
	can use well-known interface identifiers for servers/router/etc.
	This variable can be configured via sysctl
	net.inet6.ip6.auto_linklocal or by the IP6_AUTO_LINKLOCAL kernel
	compilation option.  If you configure the variable via sysctl, you
	should be sure that no interface has been up.
	Note that the variable effects all interfaces.  When you set the
	variable to 0, you should configure link-local addresses for all
	interfaces that you might want to use.
	
Fri Feb  9 00:51:01 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/in6.h: correct SA6_ARE_ADDR_EQUAL definition.
	  kernel responds to ping6 -w again.

Fri Feb  9 00:18:46 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/icmp6.c: negative {mtudisc,redirect}_{hi,lo}wat
	  value will turn off the checks.  See changelog on 2000/12/09.

2001-02-08  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6.c (nd6_free): returned the pointer to the
	next entry of the freed one.  Since pfxlist_onlink_check() called
	from this function could change the link structure, the caller
	would need the "real" successor of the list to avoid to refer to
	invalid memory.  This fix actually fixed a problem that the kernel
	hunged in some (rare) cases.

Wed Feb  7 21:35:26 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/kern/uipc_socket.c (netbsd/openbsd/freebsd4/bsdi4):
	  return ECONNABORTED, if the socket (tcp connection for example)
	  is disconnected by RST right before accept(2).  fixes PR 10698/12027.
	  checked with SUSv2, XNET 5.2, and Stevens (unix network programming
	  vol 1 2nd ed) section 5.11.
	  bsdi3/freebsd[23] needs some other fix here, so they are left behind.

	  NOTE: unix domain socket behavior needs checking.

2001-02-07  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/usr.sbin/netstat/route.c (p_sockaddr): removed special
	cases of ::/plen (plen > 0).  I believe it is better than the
	original behavior, which printed those routes "v6-in-v4 default".

Wed Feb  7 16:19:19 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/raw_ip6.c (netbsd/openbsd): validate/notify path MTU
	  discovery correctly for raw ip6 sockets.
	  note: since ping6 does not use connect(2) for the socket for
	  outgoing traffic, ping6 will have issues with route pointer kept
	  in in6pcb - need to restart ping6 to reflect new pmtu.

Wed Feb  7 01:08:46 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd/sys/net/route.c: ignore redirect attempt, if we are to
	  create/update routing entry with the same value in rt_key and
	  rt_gateway.  response to NetBSD PR 4827.  experimental.

2001-02-06  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6.c (nd6_p2p_rtrequest): removed.  It was
	introduced long long ago, and is not necessary any more,
	especially after the recent clarification on the address/prefix
	management.

Tue Feb  6 13:08:24 JST 2001 itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/nd6*.c: minimize number of log() or printf() on inbound
	  packet processing path, to avoid /var from get filled up with with
	  bogus packet storms.
	* sys/netinet6/icmp6.c: supply new sysctl net.inet6.icmp6.nd6_debug,
	  to turn on/off error/warning messages on inbonud ND/ICMPv6 packets.
	  disabled by default, can be enabled by default if you have
	  "options ND6_DEBUG".
	* sys/netinet6: OLD_LOOPBACK_IF is no longer supported (see changelog
	  on 2000/7/30).

2001-02-06  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6.c (in6_update_ifa): always set the
	destination address when specified regardless of the type of the
	interface.  This would solve a problem that bsdi3 could not add a
	route that has ::1 as the gateway (bsdi3 specific, maybe).
	This fix was in response to a report from Tomomi Suzuki
	<stomomi@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>.

Tue Feb  6 10:49:36 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c: correct m->m_pkthdr.rcvif setting for
	  own linklocal address cases.  broken around Feb 2.

2001-02-05  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* *BSD/sbin/ifconfig/ifconfig.c: marked "temporary" for temporary
	IPv6 addresses (see the next log).

2001-02-05  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/: implemented RFC 3014 Privacy Extensions for
	Stateless Address Autoconfiguration.  You can enable this by
	# sysctl -w net.inet6.ip6.use_tempaddr=1
	before accepting an RA.  Once enabled, the kernel will configure
	temporary addresses as well as public autoconfigured ones, as
	described in the RFC.  Also, the kernel will prefer temporary
	addresses to public autoconfigured ones as the source address for
	a new communication.  For more details about the selection
	algorithm, see 1.6 of the KAME IMPLEMENTATION file.

2001-02-04  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6 (bunch of files): completely revisited address
	and prefix manipulation:
	- centralize addition or removal of addresses to make code
	  maintainance easier.
	- separate address manipulation and prefix manipulation, including
	  + completely separate address lifetimes and prefix lifetimes.
	  + separate on-link determination from address autoconfiguration.
	  + separate route for a node's own address (to a loopback
	    interface) from an interface's direct route.
	  + separate the notion of detached addresses and the notion of
	    detached prefixes.  The latter can now be designated by the
	    "D" bit of the output from "ndp -p".
	- more conformance to RFC 2462 address autoconfiguration.
	- clarify a notion of autoconfigured addresses.

	Note: the change is so drastic, so you will probably have to clean
	all your source tree up, and then rebuild the entire kernel and
	applications.

2001-02-04  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6.h (IFA6_IS_{DEPRECATED, INVALID}): added
	to hide implementation of address lifetimes.  As a middle term
	solution, we should clarify the relationship among ia6t_xxx
	members and the IN6_IFF_DEPRECATED flag.  When you add code about
	address lifetimes, do not assume its implementation, and stick to
	use these macros.

2001-02-04  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/rtadvd/rtadvd.c (main): the -R (router renumbering)
	option is currently ignored (with a warning message).  We will
	re-enable the option after clarifying the address/prefix
	manipulation in the kernel, and implementing missing stuff within
	rtadvd (hopefully soon).

2001-02-04  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/prefix/prefix.sh (prefix): added as a tiny replacement
	of original prefix(8), based on recent clarification on the kernel
	prefix/address manipulation engine.  "Tiny" means that it does NOT
	provide complete backward compatibility with the original one.  It
	can just do simple set/delete operations using ifconfig(8) as a
	backend.  Thus, users are rather recommended not to use the prefix
	command, but should use ifconfig (8) explicitly.

Sun Feb  4 11:21:15 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* freebsd*: do not remove prefix list on net.inet6.ip6.forwarding
	  change from 0 to 1.  the behavior is confusing, and not friendly
	  with recent changes to on-link determination logic.

2001-02-01  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/rtadvd/config.c (getconfig):
	* kame/kame/rtadvd/advcap.c (agetnum):
	use a long long integer to parse numeric values to unitentional
	overflow for 32 bits integers.  With this change, you can specify
	very large value (i.e. values larger than 0x80000000) for valid
	and preferred lifetimes.
	XXX: we assume the type "long long" is more than 32 bits in length.

2001-02-01  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* {bsdi[34],freebsd4,netbsd,openbsd}/sbin/ifconfig/ifconfig.c:
	added a new modifier "autoconf" for IPv6 addresses.
	For example, when you configure an IPv6 address like this
	# ifconfig ne0 inet6 3ffe:ffff::1 prefixlen 64 autoconf
	and a router advertises RA with the prefix information for
	3ffe:ffff::, then the lifetimes of the address will be adjusted
	according to the RA.

Wed Jan 31 17:43:23 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.cojp
	* racoon:
	If the file for saving SA information is specified in the
	configuration file, racoon will save a SA information to the file
	when negotiation will succeed.  If you launch racoon with tye -B
	option and if the file is specified, she will install SAs into the
	kernel during intialization.  racoon cleans the file when she
	shutdowns normally.  The function is useful when an abnormal
	system shutdown happened, because SAs will remain at the peer.  In
	this case, you can use the -B option then SAs will revive.

	XXX racoon simply adds SAs to the end of the file specified.

Tue Jan 30 05:03:01 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* route6d: corrected RTA_NETMASK handling (do not look at sa_family).
	  bug report from IIJ SEIL team.

Mon Jan 29 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* {freebsd*,openbsd}/ports/bind: disable it for security issues.
	  these were based on 8.1.2...
	* freebsd4/include/netdb.h: do not pollute namespace by inclusion of
	  sys/types.h.  declare _BSD_SOCKLEN_T_ in machine/ansi.h, avoid
	  duplicated declarations.
	  based on SUSv2, netdb.h should not pull in sys/types.h.
	  if your code become not compilable due to the change, it is because
	  of bug (or SUSv2 non-conformance) in your code.
	  (you can't assume that netdb.h would pull in sys/types.h)

Mon Jan 29 00:24:00 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet/icmp6.h: synchronize some of declarations, like RA packet
	  header structure and value #defines with 2292bis-02.

Sun Jan 28 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd: synchronize with netbsd-current change to cloning routes.
	  (1) cloning routes will be marked with RTF_CLONED.  (2) RTF_CLONED
	  routes go away when RTF_CLONING routes go away (= ARP cache goes away
	  when interface address goes away)  (3) permit overwrite of RTF_CLONED 
	  by static route settings.

2001-01-27  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/libinet6/getaddrinfo.c: obsoleted EAI_ADDRFAMILY and
	EAI_NODATA according to the rfc2553bis-02 draft.
	* {bsdi3, freebsd4, netbsd, openbsd}/include/netdb.h:
	* bsdi4/contrib/bind/src/include/netdb.h:
	removed the definition of the obsoleted error types.  In order to
	minimize the possibility of binary compatibily breakage, we did
	not reorder the error number sequence.

Fri Jan 26 00:12:48 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* bsdi3: support ART routing table lookup algorithm.
	* bsdi4: support ART routing table lookup algorithm.  inet6 only
	  due to the use of custom host lookup logic in inet.

Thu Jan 25 12:26:32 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* racoon:
	Fixed to handle variable-length DH shared secret correctly.
	from <yamaya@inf.furukawa.co.jp>

Wed Jan 24 10:31:29 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ip6_fw.[ch]: pull security patch (fixes "established"
	  tcp filter) from FreeBSD-SA-01:08.ipfw.
	  NOTE: IPv4 ip_fw.[ch] on freebsd[234] are NOT patched (yet).

Wed Jan 24 09:32:16 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/net/radix_art.[ch]: ART routing table lookup algorithm.
	  (memory eater, but should be faster).  currently netbsd/openbsd only.

Wed Jan 24 02:46:42 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd: make MIP6 kernel compile again.

2001-01-23  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/rtadvd/config.c (getconfig): made sure to zero-clear
	manually configured prefix information structures.  Without this,
	rtadvd would not work when you configure advertised prefixes
	manually.  Please be sure to update.  This bug seemed to be
	introduced on around 2000-11-11.

Tue Jan 23 22:14:08 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* freebsd4: share sys/netinet6/ipsec.h.  sys/netinet6/ipsec6.h is gone.
	  NOTE: "make TARGET=freebsd4 clean" is necessary on upgrade.

2001-01-23  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6.c (in6_update_ifa, in6_ifscrub):
	considered cases where multiple addresses with a same single
	prefix are assigned on multiple interfaces.  For example, you can
	configure
	# ifconfig ne0 3ffe:ffff::1111 alias
	# ifconfig ne1 3ffe:ffff::aaaa alias
	then both two addresses can be assigned on ne0 and ne1, resp., and
	the corresponding interface route 3ffe:ffff::/64 goes to the
	interface ne0 (i.e. 1st cofirgured one wins).  If you then delete
	the address on ne0, the interface route switches the associated
	interface to ne1.
	(we do not recommend users such a configuration, though).

Tue Jan 23 18:09:08 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ip6_input.c: declare ip6aux structure, which is used
	  to pass around information about the packet, across header processing
	  routines.  we plan to put header chain parsing history into here.
	* sys/netinet6/dest6.c: support home agent destination option.
	  it is made mandatory by mobile-ip6 spec.
	  XXX may have broke ericsson mobile-ip6

2001-01-23  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/net/if_gif.c (gif_ioctl): set IFF_RUNNING upon sucess
	of the SIOCSIFPHYADDR ioctl (and its variations).  This is
	necessary to perform DAD on a gif interface.

2001-01-23  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6.c (in6_ifinit): clarified on installation
	of interface direct routes;
	- made an interface route only when
	  + prefixlen is smaller than 128, or
	  + the destination address is specified.
	- set the cloning bit of an interface route only when the prefix
	  length is smaller than 128.  And, in this case, the bit is
	  always set regardless of the interface type.  In particular, an
	  interface route with the cloning bit would be configured on a
	  p2p interface.
	This mean you can now invoke the following command:

	# ifconfig gif0 inet6 3ffe:ffff::1

	Note that there is no destination address specified, and the
	prefix length is implicitly set 64.  Also note that the
	corresponding interface route of the address would have the
	cloning bit, and neighbor caches would be created when you try to
	communicate with a destination that matches the prefix
	3ffe:ffff::/64.
	
	In summary, by the two consecutive changes, the only possible
	commands you can type are:
	# ifconfig gif0 inet6 IPv6address prefixlen plen
	(where IPv6address is an IPv6 address, plen < 128) and
	# ifconfig gif0 inet6 IPv6address IPv6dstaddress prefixlen 128	
	(where IPv6address and IPv6dstaddress are IPv6 addresses)

2001-01-23  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6.c (in6_update_ifa): made the argument
	validation stricter; if a destination address is specified for the
	SIOCAIFADDR_IN6 ioctl, its prefix MUST be 128. As an effect, the
	kernel now refuses the following command:
	# ifconfig gif0 inet6 3ffe:ffff::1 3ffe:ffff::2 alias
	(note that the default prefix length is 64).
	You should explicitly specify 128 as the prefix length:
	# ifconfig gif0 inet6 3ffe:ffff::1 3ffe:ffff::2 prefixlen 128 alias

	You may think this is too restrictive, but I believe it's better
	than before. We've seen many users confused about configration of
	p2p interfaces.

Tue Jan 23 13:51:34 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ipsec.c: record IPsec decapsulation history information,
	  so that we can use it for validating inbound packets at L4.
	* netbsd: run ipfilter only for wire format packets, not the IPsec-
	  decapsulated ones.
	  
Tue Jan 23 03:44:03 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd/openbsd: make sure do not return garbage, when accept(2) is
	  called after socket is disconnected (like RST right after TCP
	  establishment).

Mon Jan 22 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* route6d: advertise aggregated route, only to interfaces specified
	  after -A option.  found by IIJ IPv6 router torture testers.

2001-01-21  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/nd6_rtr.c (in6_{ifadd, ifdel}): ifa_refcnt
	clarifications:
	- do not IFAREF in in6_ifadd() (except on nbsd)
	- do not duplicate IFAFREE in in6_ifdel() (except on nbsd)
	without these changes, a manually configured ifaddr would be freed
	two times when its lifetime expired. Although such a situation
	would be rare, all *BSD (except NetBSD)	users (who use versions
	after Jan 2, 2001) are recommended to apply this fix.

Sun Jan 21 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* libinet6/getaddrinfo.c: disallow invalid scope identifier
	  (like fe80::1%junk).  it was broken around Jan 5 2001.

2001-01-21  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/sbin/ifconfig/ifconfig.c (main): set IPv6 address
	lifetimes correctly (i.e. set infinite). Without this, ifconfig
	would not be able to assign IPv6 addresses.

Sun Jan 21 00:26:47 PST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ip6_input.c: do not accept packet to link-local address
	  on loopback interface, if the destination address is not assigned
	  to the node itself.  fixes KAME PR 250.

Sun Jan 21 01:37:23 2001  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* sys/netinet6/{nd6.c,nd6_nbr.c,nd6.h}: implement garbage
	  collection for a stale NDP entry, as described in RFC2461
	  5.3. Each entry will be removed in 1day by default.

2001-01-21  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/bin/ping/ping.c: corrected the output format when the
	command is build without "INET6" being defined.

2001-01-21  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/sys/netinet/udp_usrreq.c (udp_input):
	* bsdi4/sys/netinet/tcp_input.c (tcp_input):
	made a local copy of the IPv6 header and called in6_clearscope()
	(which was newly implemented with this change) to remove
	(possibly) embedded scope identifiers.
	XXX: this change would reduce efficiency, but is necessary to
	compute checksum correctly for a packet with scoped source or
	destination addresses.
	All BSD/OS 4.2 users are recommended to apply this fix.

Sat Jan 20 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ipsec.c: candidate fix for KAME PR 233 (tunnelled packet
	  may cause bad ARP).

Fri Jan 19 17:09:17 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet/icmp6.h: synchronize RR flag bit definitions to
	  RFC2894.  you need to compile every system you have, to make RR work.
	  KAME PR 300.

2001-01-19  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/sys/i386/isa/if_ef.c (efintr): do not use the sentinel
	pointer stored in ef_mb, and force the EF_NEWM macro to create a
	fresh mbuf chain to store incoming ether frames (with mbuf cluster
	if necessary). This fix is essential to the KAME IPv6 stack
	(without the m_pulldown stuff), so please be sure to apply this
	fix if you use IPv6 on an interface using the ef driver.

2001-01-18  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/contrib/bind/src/lib/irs/{lcl,nis}_ho.c: set ho_addrinfo
	function(s) properly. Without this fix, getaddrinfo() could cause
	SEGV when "local" or "nis" is specified to look hosts up. Be sure
	to update.

Thu Jan 18 02:00:32 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd, openbsd, bsdi4: fix unsafe typecast in rtrequest1().
	  clarify 3rd arg handling in eonrtrequest().
	* netbsd, openbsd: integrate post-4.4BSD rtrequest1(), and argument
	  type change on ifa_rtrequest (3rd arg).

2001-01-16  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/dtcp/dtcps.rb (tunnelcleanup): deleted the pair of
	physical addresses by "gifconfig delete" after the session. This
	would prevent a garbage pair.

Tue Jan 16 00:43:19 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/mld6.c: emit MLD6 packet correctly (MTU setting was
	  wrong and the packet did not go out of the node).  the bug was
	  introduced around November 27, 2000.

Mon Jan 15 12:53:37 JST 2001  yu-inoue@jp.fujitsu.com
	* route6d:
	  when an interface goes down, do not advertise routes associated with
	  the interface, more like vendor routers.  by doing so, we can
	  avoid blackhole route (advertised even though the router lost
	  reachability), and we can switch to alternate route if one exists.
	  NOTE: it may cause reachability problem to the router itself, if
	  the router has interfaces without global addresses.

Sat Jan 13 12:45:56 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet/ip_output.c: allow interface index to be specified with
	  multicast set/getsockopts, by using 0.0.0.0/8 (= pass it as network
	  endian value, 24bit in in_addr).  follows RFC1724 section 3.3.
	  suggested by Dave Thaler.

Fri Jan 12 18:54:52 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* bsdi4: use BSD/OS 4.2 as the base version.

Thu Jan 11 02:47:37 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* kame/sys/netkey/key.c:
	- key_acquire() does not require a secpolicy structure.
	  There was a possibility of kernel panic.
	  reported by <dwang@iPolicyNet.COM>.

Thu Jan 11 02:46:09 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* racoon:
	- saved the type of SA in PF_KEY acquire message from the kernel
	  in order to reply a error.
	- removed from the scheduler immediately if error happened when sending
	  phase 1 initiation message.

Wed Jan 10 11:41:30 JST 2001 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* racoon:
	- Fixed to configure the logging level.  racoon saves some parameters
	  before parsing configuration file in order to prefer the parameters
	  by command line.

Wed Jan 10 00:19:59 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/icmp6.c: fix SEGV on icmp6 redirect input.
	  openbsd/netbsd only.  was introduced early Dec2000.

Tue Jan  9 16:50:07 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* kame/libinet6/getaddrinfo.c: share getaddrinfo source code (again)
	  across all platforms we have.  though we have a jumbo #ifdef at the
	  bottom for DNS lookup portion, it is good to share the core logic.
	  while we are at it, simplify lots of things.
	  freebsd4 behavior change: $GAI support is dropped.  classful notation
	  (127.1) is dropped.

2001-01-07  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6_pcb.c (in6_pcbnotify):
	* {bsdi4,freebsd[34],openbsd}/sys/netinet6/in6_pcb.c (in6_pcbbind):
	allowed an application to bind a socket to a deprecated address.
	For openbsd, a new check if the specified address is a node's own
	address was added as well.

2001-01-07  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* freebsd3/ports/libbind8: newly added based on BIND 8.2.2p7. This
	libbind supported A6 and DNAME.

2001-01-06  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/prefix/prefix.c: changed the default values of
	prefixes to infinity. Finite default values were bad, because they
	would be installed as the lifetimes of routers' addresses, which
	would never increment and be invalidated in the future.

	NOTE: if you use the kernel that has the change made on 2000-12-03
	by Koji Kawano (see CHANGELOG.2000) on a router box, and use the
	prefix command to assign addresses for the router, please be sure
	to update the prefix command and reboot the router (or at least
	reassign the addresses by the new prefix command). The lifetimes
	might now be decresing, and will expire in the near future.

	We'd even recommend you not to use the prefix command. It has
	recently caused many problematic situations, and almost no one
	understands the kernel prefix management routines well. You can do
	the same thing by the ordinally ifconfig command. See the latest
	rc.net6.sample file.

2001-01-06  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/etc/rc.net6: prohibit the prefix command by default.
	Since the command has recently caused many problems, we should
	reconsider the prefix management mechanism.

Fri Jan  5 22:51:16 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* libinet6/name6.c: nuke getnodeby{name,addr}, which was mentioned
	  only in draft-ietf-ipngwg-bsd-api-new-01.txt.

Fri Jan  5 13:24:21 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* getaddrinfo.c (shared/netbsd/openbsd/freebsd4)
	  query DNS only once per an AF.

2001-01-05  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/contrib/bind/src/lib/irs/gethostent.c: allowed gethostbyname
	to accept abbreviated IPv4 text addresses (like 127.1).
	(XXX: this change is against a bind8 policy, but just for backward
	compatibility.)

2001-01-02  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* freebsd3/lib/libinet6/Makefile: do not link resolver files when
	USE_LIBBIND6 is YES, so that enhanced libbind could be tested.
	* freebsd3/*/Makefile.inc: when USE_LIBBIND6 is YES, link libbind
	(as well as libinet6).

Tue Jan  2 17:15:44 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/in6{,_ifattach}.c: correct use of IFAREF/IFFREE on
	  non-netbsd operating systems.  old code had memory leak possibility
	  on SIOCDIFADDR_IN6.  reported by hitachi guys.

2001-01-01  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/lib/libinet6:
	* bsdi4/contrib/bind/src/lib:
	massive improvements on DNS resolver including
	- IPv6 transport of DNS resolver. An IPv6 textual address can now
	  be in the /etc/resolv.conf file as a DNS server.
	- support of A6 and DNAME with bit string labels. They are still
	  very experimental, and thus disabled by default. "options a6"
	  and "options dname" in the /etc/resolv.conf file would enable A6
	  and DNAME, respectively.
	- EDNS0 OPT RR support with UDP buffer size negotiation, which is
	  disabled by default, and would enabled by "options edns0" in the
	  /etc/resolv.conf file.
	- clarification on the relationship between address family and irs
	  functions. For example, if you call getaddrinfo with AF_UNSPEC,
	  and irs.conf specifies to consider the local hosts file first,
	  then getaddrinfo would try to resolve an address in the
	  following order:
	  + IPv6 addresses in the hosts file.
	  + IPv4 addresses in the hosts file.
	  + IPv6 addresses via DNS.
	  + IPv4 addresses via DNS.
	  And, if one of the first two attempts succeeded, the remaining
	  two methods would be skipped. This change of the behavior would
	  be useful if you put both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses in the hosts
	  file, and do not want to see redundant DNS packets.
