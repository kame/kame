# abuse of IPv4 mapped address.  under the following conditions:
# - the victim kernel stack does not check against IPv4 mapped address on
#   IPv6 native packet
# - the victim node runs udp echo service (inetd) on AF_INET6 socket
# the victim node can generate IPv4 broadcast responses mistakenly,
# leading to DoS.
#
# the example also tries bypass access controls and attack inside the firewall
# from outside (works nicer when 9.0.0.1 is an IPv4 firewall).
#
# you can attack any udp services by the same way.  udp echo service works the
# best for bad guys (or the worst for victims) since udp packet format is
# common to IPv4 and IPv6, and echo service is common for IPv4 and IPv6.
# therefore, the broadcast response will call for more responses (assumption:
# inetd does not check udp source port).
#	attacker -> victim: from ::ffff:10.255.255.255 to ::ffff:9.0.0.1
#	victim -> broadcast: from 9.0.0.1 to 10.255.255.255
#	more response: from many guys to 9.0.0.1
#
# RFC2553 does NOT comment on this case.  also, if the victim node supports
# SIIT (RFC2765) environment, the kernel stack is unable to filter out
# the packet.
#
# to protect your implmentation from the attack, there are multiple ways.
# the author recommends to implement the first three items at least:
# 1. do not support IPv4 mapped address on AF_INET6 API (not compatible with
#    RFC2553 section 4.2).
# 2. implement 2553bis-03 IPV6_V6ONLY socket option, and make the default value
#    to on (the default value suggested by the document is "off").
#    this has almost the same effect as the first bullet (if userland
#    code changes IPV6_V6ONLY manually, you will become vulnerable again
#    depending on userland program).   the change will make your stack
#    incompatible with 2553bis-03 section 4.2.  
# 3. drop any IPv6 native packet with IPv4 mapped address (incompatible with
#    RFC2765).
# 4. on EVERY userland application check the IPv6 source address, if it
#    embeds bad IPv4 address (impossible in reality, as it's hard to know what
#    is "bad" address, and there are millions of coders in different places)
#
# of course, KAME is not affected.  the implementation status differs
# between *BSD base systems (due to policy differences in *BSD).
# - KAME/OpenBSD: (1) and (3) - always safe
# - KAME/NetBSD: (2) and (3) - safe as long as userland programmer does
#	not change IPV6_V6ONLY
# - KAME/FreeBSD and KAME/BSDI: (3) - subject to API complications

# abuse of 6to4.  under the following conditions:

#
# 6to4 RFC suggests checks against embedded broadcat addresses, but it
# does not work in reality.  for example, 9.0.0.1 has no idea about topology
# within 16.0.0.0/8 topology, and has no idea about IPv4 broadcast address
# assignments.
# because of this, the following example tries to generate a packet to
# 16.255.255.255 by using 9.0.0.1 (6to4 relay) as trampoline, and hide the
# identity of the real attacker.
# if the admin at 16.0.0.0/8 is careful enough to drop directed broadcasts,
# the scenario does not work.
#
# 6to4 RFC has a comment for embedded broadcast/multicast case, as well as
# private address cases.  so if an implementation follows the suggestion,
# there is less chance for vulnerability.  but - beware, "less" chance, not
# "no" chance.  you are still vulnerable to some of the scenarios.
#
# KAME is not affected, as long as you don't configure your machine as 6to4
# relay.  if you configure KAME as 6to4 relay, you are vulnerable to some
# of the attack scenarios.
