.Os KAME
.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcp6c
.Nd DHCPv6 client daemon
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c Ar configfile
.Op Fl Ddf
.Op Fl p Ar pid-file
.Ar interface
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
works as a DHCPv6 client and gets information from DHCPv6 servers
to configure the specified
.Ar interface .
.Pp
The command line options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\"
.It Fl c Ar configfile
Use
.Ar configfile
as the configuration file.
.It Fl d
Print debugging messages.
.It Fl D
Even more debugging information is printed.
.It Fl f
Foreground mode (useful when debugging).
Although
.Nm
usually prints warning, debugging, or error messages to
.Xr syslog 8 ,
it prints the messages to standard error if this option is
specified.
.It Fl p Ar pid-file
Use
.Ar pid-file
to dump the process ID of
.Nm .
.El
.Pp
The program will daemonize itself on invocation unless the
.Fl f
option is specified.
.Pp
Upon receipt of the
.Dv SIGHUP
or
.Dv SIGTERM
signals,
.Nm
will remove all stateful resources from the system.
In the former case the daemon will then reinvoke itself,
while it will stop running in the latter case.
In either case,
.Nm
will send DHCPv6 Release messages to release resources assigned from servers.
.\"
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/local/v6/etc/dhcp6c.conf -compact
.It Pa /var/run/dhcp6c.pid
is the default file that contains pid of the currently running
.Nm dhcp6c .
.It Pa /usr/local/v6/etc/dhcp6c.conf
is the default configuration file.
.It Pa /var/db/dhcp6c_duid
is the file to store the client's DUID.
.El
.Sh Configuration Script
When
.Nm
receives a reply message,
it will invoke a supplementary configuration script specified in the
.Xr dhcp6c.conf 5
file.
The daemon will provide the script with configuration parameters as
environment variables,
which include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic REASON
The reason why the script is invoked.
As of this writing,
the value is always
\(dqNBI\(dq
and thus meaningless.
.It Ic new_domain_name_servers
A list of available DNS servers,
each of which is an IPv6 numeric address and is separated by a white
space character.
.It Ic new_domain_name
A list of DNS names,
which provides DNS name search path.
.It Ic new_ntp_servers
A list of available NTP servers,
each of which is an IPv6 numeric address and is separated by a white
space character.
.It Ic new_sip_name_servers
A list of available SIP server addresses,
each of which is an IPv6 numeric address and is separated by a white
space character.
.It Ic new_sip_name
A list of SIP server domain names.
.El
.Pp
Note that the daemon does not always provide all the parameters.
It sets an environment variable only when the corresponding
configuration parameter is provided by the DHCPv6 server.

.Re
.\"
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
.\"
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
is incomplete and violates DHCPv6 protocol spec, in several aspects.
In particular, it does not handle address allocation via DHCPv6.
This is, however, rather intentional;
the authors believe stateless address autoconfiguration is enough for
IPv6 and will not implement the stateful method in the future.
.Pp
Most useful option type values,
including those related to prefix delegation,
are still not officially assigned.
The current implementation uses experimental values,
which may cause interoperability problems with other implementations.
