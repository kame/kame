2005-07-22  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/dhcp6: fixed memory leak for renew/rebind event data.
	(KAME PR 872 reported by Meng Huan Hsieh)

2005-05-03  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/dhcp6/dhcp6c_ia.c (ia_timo): kept the latest server's
	DUID even in the REBIND state in case of sending a Release message
	in that state.

2005-05-03  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/dhcp6/cfparse.y: corrected "address parameters" so
	that we don't have to specify the meaningless (but mandatory)
	prefix length in the context of IA_NA.

2005-05-03  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/dhcp6/config.c (configure_commit): made sure that
	interface parameters are initialized with the default values even
	if the interface is not explicitly configured in the configuration
	file.  This particularly made sure that the preference option is
	not included unless explicitly specified.  A memory leakage for
	the client when specifying a script file was also fixed.

2005-04-29  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/dhcp6/dhcp6c.c (client6_mainloop): corrected error
	handling for select(2) in order to avoid unexpected blocking when
	receiving a signal.

2005-04-27  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6.c (in6_update_ifa): always updated
	ia6_updatetime regardless of whether the address is created or
	updated.  This is necessary so that the expiration times will be
	updated	correctly when the lifetiems of an existing address are
	modified by hand or by a process such as a DHCPv6 client.

2005-04-26  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/dhcp6/addrconf.c (na_ifaddrconf): corrected lifetime
	arguments to ifaddrconf().

2005-03-30  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/dhcp6/addrconf.c (update_address): make sure that
	the lifetimes of addresses are updated when the client receives a
	Reply in response to Renew or Rebind.

2005-03-02  SUZUKI, Shinsuke <suz@kame.net>
	* kame/kame/dhcp6/dhcp6.c: fixed a DHCPv6-client 
	  initialization failure when a node has no IPv6 global address.

2005-03-02  SUZUKI, Shinsuke <suz@kame.net>
	* kame/kame/dhcp6/dhcp6relay.[c8]: supports multiple client-side 
	  interfaces

2005-01-12  suz@crl.hitachi.co.jp
	* kame/kame/dhcp6: implemented stateful non-temporary address 
	  assignment.

2004-12-03  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/dhcp6/common.c: silenced strict-aliasing warnings.
	Otherwise dhcp6 could not be built with -O2 on FreeBSD 5.3.
	(KAME-PR 851)

2004-12-02  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/dhcp6/config.c (configure_commit): corrected list
	management operation.  (mostly harmless, but it was incorrect.)
	From: Nicolas Dichtel

2004-11-28  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/dhcp6: catch up draft-ietf-dhc-lifetime-02.
	Specifically,
	- renamed "lifetime" to "refreshtime".  Note that configuration
	  compatibility was lost
	- implemented the default and minimum timer values
	- clarified that the refresh time option can only be available for
	  Information-request and reply exchanges

2004-09-07  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/dhcp6: provided a new command "dhcp6ctl", deprecating
	dhcp6sctl.  This new command controls the client as well as the
	server.  For the client, the "start" and "stop" (which can specify
	a particular interface) commands are available.

2004-09-04  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/dhcp6: added the ability of dhcp6c to work on multiple
	interfaces simultaneously.
