.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcp6c.conf
.Nd DHCPv6 client configuration file
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /usr/local/v6/etc/dhcp6c.conf
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains configuration information for KAME's DHCPv6 client,
.Nm dhcp6c .
The configuration file consists of a sequence of statements terminated
by a semi-colon (`;').
Statements are composed of tokens separated by white space,
which can be any combination of blanks,
tabs and newlines.
In some cases a set of statements is combined with a pair of brackets,
which is regarded as a single token.
Lines beginning with
.Ql #
are comments.
.Sh Interface specification
There are some statements that may or have to specify interface.
Interfaces are specified in the form of "name unit", such as
.Ar fxp0
and
.Ar gif1.
.\"
.Sh DHCPv6 options
Some configuration statements take the description of a DHCPv6 option
as an argument.
The followings are the format and description of available DHCPv6
options.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic domain-name-servers
.Xc
means a Domain Name Server option.
.It Xo
.Ic domain-name
.Xc
means a domain name option.
.It Xo
.Ic ntp-servers
.Xc
means an NTP server option.
.It Ic ia-pd Ar ID
means an IA_PD
.Pq Identity Association for Prefix Delegation
option.
.Ar ID
is a decimal number of the IAID
.Pq see below about identity associations .
.It Ic rapid-commit
means a rapid-commit option.
.El
.\"
.Sh Interface statement
An interface statement specifies configuration parameters on the
interface.
The generic format of an interface statement is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic interface Ar interface
{
.Ar substatements
};
.Xc
The followings are possible
.Ar substatements
in an interface statement.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic send Ar send-options
;
.Xc
This statement specifies DHCPv6 options to be sent to the server(s).
Some options can only appear in particular messages according to the
specification,
in which case the appearance of the options is limited to be compliant
with the specification.
.Pp
.Ar send-options
is a comma-separated list of options,
each of which should be specified as described above.
Multiple
.Ic send
statements can also be specified,
in which case all the specified options will be sent.
.Pp
When
.Ic rapid-commit
is specified,
.Nm dhcp6c
will include a rapid-commit option in solicit messages and wait for
an immediate reply instead of advertisements.
When
.Ic ia-pd
is specified,
.Nm dhcp6c
will initiate prefix delegation as a requesting router by 
including an IA_PD option with the specified
.Ar ID
in solicit messages.
In this case, a corresponding identity association statement
must exist with the same
.Ar ID .
.It Ic request Ar request-options ;
This statement specifies DHCPv6 options to be included in an
option-request option.
.Ar request-options
is a comma-separated list of options,
which can consist of the following options.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic domain-name-servers
.Xc
requests a list of Domain Name Server addresses.
.It Xo
.Ic domain-name
.Xc
requests a DNS search path.
.It Xo
.Ic ntp-servers
.Xc
requests a list of NTP server addresses.
.It Xo
.Ic lifetime
.Xc
means a lifetime option.
This is particularly useful when sent with information-request messages.
.El
Multiple
.Ic request
statements can also be specified,
in which case all the specified options will be requested.
.It Ic information-only ;
This statement specifies
.Nm dhcp6c
to only exchange informational configuration parameters with servers.
A list of DNS server addresses is an example of such parameters.
This statement is useful when the client does not need stateful
configuration parameters such as IPv6 addresses or prefixes.
.It Ic script Ar \(dqscript-name\(dq ;
This statement specifies a path to script invoked by
.Nm dhcp6c
on a certain condition including when the daemon receives a reply
message.
.Ar script-name
must be the absolute path from root to the script file, be a regular
file, and be created by the same owner who runs the daemon.
.El
.El
.\"
.Sh Identity association statement
Identity association
.Pq IA
is a key notion of DHCPv6.
An IA is uniquely identified in a client by a pair of IA type and
IA identifier
.Pq IAID .
An IA is associated with configuration information dependent on the IA type.
.Pp
An identity association statement defines a single IA with some
client-side configuration parameters.
Its format is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic id-assoc Ar type Op Ar ID
{
.Ar substatements
};
.Xc
.Ar type
is a string for the type of this IA.
The current implementation only supports
.Ic pd
as the type, which means prefix delegation.
.Ar ID
is a decimal number of IAID.
If omitted, the value 0 will be used by default.
.Ar substatements
is a sequence of statements that specifies configuration parameters
for this IA.
Each statement may or may not be specific to the type of IA.
The followings are possible
.Ar substatements
for an IA of type
.Ic pd .
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic Ar prefix_interface_statement
;
.Xc
specifies the client's local configuration of how delegated prefixes
should be used
.Pq see below .
.It Ic prefix Ar ipv6-prefix pltime Op Ar vltime ;
specifies a prefix and related parameters that the client wants to be
delegated.
Multiple prefixes can be specified, each of which is described as a
separate
.Ic prefix
substatement.
.Nm dhcp6c
will include all the prefixes
.Pq and related parameters
in Solicit messages,
as an IA_PD prefix option encapsulated in the corresponding IA_PD
option.
Note, however, that the server may or may not respect the specified
prefix parameters.
For parameters of the
.Ic prefix
substatement,
see
.Xr dhcp6s.conf 5 .
.El
.El
.\"
.Sh Prefix interface statement
A prefix interface statement specifies configuration parameters of
prefixes on local interfaces that are derived from delegated prefixes.
A prefix interface statement can only appear as a substatement of
an identity association statement with the type
.Ic pd .
The generic format of an interface statement is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic prefix-interface Ar interface
{
.Ar substatements
};
.Xc
When an IPv6 prefix is delegated from a DHCPv6 server,
.Nm dhcp6c
will assign a prefix on the
.Ar interface
unless the interface receives the DHCPv6 message that contains the prefix
with the delegated prefix and the parameters provided in
.Ar substatements .
Possible substatements are as follows.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic sla-id Ar ID
;
.Xc
This statement specifies the identifier value of the site-level aggregator
.Pq SLA
on the interface.
.Ar ID
must be a decimal integer which fits in the length of SLA IDs
.Pq see below .
For example,
if
.Ar ID
is 1 and the client is delegated an IPv6 prefix 2001:db8:ffff::/48,
.Nm dhcp6c
will combine the two values into a single IPv6 prefix,
2001:db8:ffff:1::/64,
and will configure the prefix on the specified
.Ar interface .
.It Xo
.Ic sla-len Ar length
;
.Xc
This statement specifies the length of the SLA ID in bits.
.Ar length
must be a decimal number between 0 and 128.
If the length is not specified by this statement,
the default value 16 will be used.
.El
.El
.\"
.Sh Examples
The followings are a sample configuration to be delegated an IPv6
prefix from an upstream service provider.
With this configuration
.Nm dhcp6c
will send solicit messages containing an IA_PD option,
with an IAID 0,
on to an upstream PPP link,
.Ar ppp0 .
After receiving some prefixes from a server,
.Nm dhcp6c
will then configure derived IPv6 prefixes with the SLA ID 1 on a
local ethernet interface,
.Ar ne0 .
Note that the IAID for the
.Ic id-assoc
statement is 0 according to the default.
.Bd -literal -offset
interface ppp0 {
        send ia-pd 0;
};

id-assoc pd {
	prefix-interface ne0 {
		sla-id 1;
	};
};
