.Sh NAME
.Nm pim6sd.conf
.Nd config file for pim6sd, PIM-SM daemon for IPv6
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm pim6sd
configuration file consists of a sequence of statements, each of which
specifies how the daemon treats each interface on the system,
specifies some parameters of the PIM protocol, and
requires some special behavior defined by the protocol.
.Pp
Lines beginning with
.Ql #
are comments.
.Pp
Note that
.Nm pim6sd
works even without the configuration file, although the daemon
will warn that there is no configuration file.
In such a case, the daemon will automatically set the default value
to each configurable parameter.
.\"
.Pp
The following statements can be specified in the configuration file.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic default_source_preference Ar preference
.Xc
Specifies a default preference value when sending a PIM assert message.
Preferences are used by assert elections to determine upstream routers.
Currently
.Nm
cannot reliably obtain preferences and metrics from the
unicast routing protocols, so a default value may be configured.
.\"
.It Ic default_source_metric Ar metric
Specifies a default metric value when sending a PIM assert message.
It is recommended that preferences be set such that metrics are never
consulted. However, default metrics may also be set and will default to
1024.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic phyint Ar interface
.Op disable
.Xc
Specifies
.Nm
to ignore the interface even if the interface is multicast-capable.
Note that PIM will be activated on all interfaces by default(including
the case where there is no configuration file).
Interfaces are specified in the form of "name unit", such as
.Ar gif0
and
.Ar ep1.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic phyint Ar interface
.Op preference Ar preference
.Op metric Ar metric
.Xc
Specifies the preference and/or metric values when sending a PIM
assert message on the interface.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic granularity Ar second
.Xc
Specifies timer granularity in seconds.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic hello_period Ar period Ar coef
.Xc
.Ar Period
specifies the period in second between 2 hello messages.
.Ar Coef
is the coefficient to determine the hello holdtime;
the holdtime will be
.Ar period
*
.Ar coef .
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic join_prune_period Ar period Ar coef
.Xc
.Ar Period
specifies the period in second between 2 join/prune messages.
.Ar Coef
is the coefficient to determine the join/prune holdtime;
the holdtime will be
.Ar period
*
.Ar coef .
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic data_timeout Ar timer
.Xc
Specifies the time after which (S,G) state for a silent source will be deleted.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic register_suppression_timeout Ar interval
.Xc
.Ar Interval
specifies the interval between receiving a Register-Stop and allowing
PIM Register to be send again.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic probe_time Ar timer
.Xc
.Ar Timer
specifies the time between sending a null Register and the
Register-Suppression-Timer expiring unless it is restarted by
receiving a Register-Stop.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic assert_timeout Ar interval
.Xc
.Ar Interval
specifies the interval between the last time an Assert is received and
the time at which the assert is timeout.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic cand_rp
.Op Ic interface Ar interface
.Op Ic time Ar time
.Op Ic priority Ar priority
.Xc
Specifies to act as a candidate Rendezvous Point(RP).
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic group_prefix Ar prefix
.Xc
When acting as a Rendezvous Point(RP),
.Ar prefix
specifies a group prefix that the RP will handle.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic cand_bootstrap_router
.Op Ic interface Ar interface
.Op Ic time Ar time
.Op Ic priority Ar priority
.Xc
Specifies to act as a candidate bootstrap router(BSR).
It is recommended to specify
.Ic cand_bootstrap_router
only in typical usage.
All other parameters are optional and will be set automatically.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic switch_register_threshold Ic rate Ar rate Ic interval Ar interval
.Xc
Specifies the threshold that a Rendezvous Point(RP) switches to a shortest
path tree, which is valid only when acting as an RP.
\"
.It Xo
.Ic switch_data_threshold Ic rate Ar rate Ic interval Ar interval
.Xc
Specifies the threshold that a last hop router switches to a shortest
path tree.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm pim6sd
command is developed by Mickael Hoerdt at LSIIT Laboratory.
It is based on IPv4 PIM sparse-mode
.Nm pimd
developed at University of Southern California,
which has also been derived from
.Nm mrouted.
