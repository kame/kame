.Sh NAME
.Nm rafixd
.Nd a daemon which disables rogue RAs from rogue machines
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rafixd
.Op Fl dDf
.Op Fl p Ar prefix
.Ar interface...
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the daemon program which disables rogue router advertisements (RAs).
It looks over all the RAs on links connected to
Ar interfaces ,
then disables the source of the RAs from becoming routers for nodes,
if RAs contain rogue prefix information.
The rogue RA sources include misconfigured routers/hosts, nodes that
impersonate as a router to hijack traffic, and so forth.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Enable debugging output to
.Xr syslog 3 .
.It Fl D
More debugging output to
.Xr syslog 3 .
.It Fl f
Do not daemonize.
Run in a foregroud mode.
.It Fl p Ar prefix
Register a
.Dq bogus
.Ar prefix .
.El
.Pp
.Nm
detects RAs that contain prefix information option that matches the prefixes
specified by
.Fl p ,
and then throws out RAs against it with router lifetime set to 0.
By doing so, those sources that have sent RAs with offending
.Ar prefix
will not be able to become routers for the nodes listening to the RAs.

.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
program exits 0 on success, and >0 on failures.
