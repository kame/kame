* At booting, a message like 
	rtinit: wrong ifa (f0810900) was (f0810c00)
was printed. This was fixed.

The causes of this bug were the followings:
	(1) ifa_ifwithaddr compares <key> and <broadaddr>.
	(2) Since IPv6 doesn't have broadcast address, 
	   ifa_broadcast is filled with zero.
	(3) bcmp() returns *0* when comparing length is zero.
	(4) Thus, ifa_ifwithaddr always returns not the appropriate
	   in6_ifaddr but the first in6_ifaddr.

There are two solutions here:
	(a) Bury ifa_broadcast with link-local all node multicast address.
	(b) Avoid comparing <key> and <broadaddr> when length is zero in
           ifa_ifwithaddr.
Currently we went to the way of (b).
