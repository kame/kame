This directory contains kame related ports only. Generic IPv6-enable
ports are distributed by original FreeBSD ports.

You can get information about recent IPv6-enable ports at:
	http://www.freebsd.org/ports/ipv6.html

WARNING: Part of the following ports are available at ports-current
only, not included in 4.x-RELEASE. But we do not support mixed
kernel/application from different versions. You need to use
ports-current at your own risk and you may require some knowledge to
mix them.
